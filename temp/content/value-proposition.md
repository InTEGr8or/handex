Handex is an ergonomic one-handed keyboard data entry device that you can type with while walking. You don't have to reposition your fingers, so you never have to look at your hand. You can use the same Handex keyboard wherever you go because it fits in your pocket, so it becomes second nature. When inspiration strikes, Handex is there, always available.
