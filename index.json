These are prior to and independent of any character mapping.\nAction/Finger Thumb Index Middel Ring Pinky pinch 0x0 0x1 0x2 0x3 0x4 grasp 0x5 0x6 0x7 0x8 0x9 pull-back 0xA 0xB 0xC 0xD 0xE From that table, you can see that the thumb occupies the 0x0, 0x5, and 0xA ordinals.\nThe Thumb occupies the modulus 5 = 0 ordinals. The Index occupies the modulus 5 = 1 ordinals. The Middle occupies the modulus 5 = 2 ordinals, etc.\nThat helps us name all the SVGs glyphs, so the Thumb keystroke glyph is located at https://handex.io/images/svgs/0.svg\nNotice that the hardware finger action ordinals are not based on keyboards. Your finger actions are prior to keyboards, and so their ordinates should not be based on how your fingers are mapped onto keyboard coordinates.\nKey to Action Mapping Having established the hardware finger actions, they can now be mapped to the keys of the standard keyboard.\nThat means that the asdf keys would be in numeric order, starting with (in hexadecimal) 0x1.\n0x1=a= 0x2=s= 0x3=d= 0x4=f=\nThose are single-click characters, corresponding to the home-row keys, but additional characters can be composed from key sequences, which are any set of keys pressed before all keys are released.\nSo we can compose new characters not on the home-row by combining home-row characters:\n0x21=g=\nd + f \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; g\nOr:\nstateDiagram state g { direction LR d --\u003e f } This gives us a way of using the home-row keys to point to non-home-row keys.\nThe d + f points to the g.\nThe jkl; characters are sent by a single click of the grasp knuckles closer to the palm.\n0x6=j= 0x7=k= 0x8=l= 0x9=;=\nSo h can be composed from k + j\nThere is an apparent mirroring between these two pointers, but observe that both pointers point to the key next to the index finger. The mirroring happens because most keyboards are made for two hands, and your two hands are mirror images of each other. Because the Handex is made for a single hand, we use the Thumb as the origin and the Index finger as the first ordinate. So the Thumb pinch is 0x0 and the Index pinch is 0x1.\nThe mirroring that I thought I identified above was actually just that I had a right-hand bias when mapping the QWERTY left-hand home-row keys. \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; should be under the pinky.\nThis made me realize that I needed a much better way to analyze the QWERTY key mapping. One step in that direction is the interactive hover-over keyboard below.\nBy using this QWERTY graphical analysis tool, I\u0026rsquo;ve remapped the number keys and most of the other keys. Nearby keys have similar mappings, now, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to reason about the key strokes. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using it for a couple of days, and I can see a distinct improvement, even while learning the modified key layout.\nThis is part of the continuous improvement that I have expected since completing the first fully functioning unit a few months ago.\nI will be putting together a roadmap of upcoming improvements on the project website on GitHub, where this site is hosted.\n","date":"25","image":null,"permalink":"https://handex.io/blog/key-mapping-for-vim/","tags":null,"title":"Key Mapping for Vim"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Log in to preserve session data\nLog in ","date":"18","image":null,"permalink":"https://handex.io/login/","tags":null,"title":"Login"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The Handex is a novel keyboard so it requires new learning.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been going through the process over the last month, so I want to record the issues I\u0026rsquo;ve faced and how I\u0026rsquo;ve overcome them.\nI also want to plot the trajectory of my performance improvement so that we can estimate the viability of using a Handex device in many novel scenarios and use cases.\nOne of my biggest performance improvements came from improving the training UI.\nInitially, I indicated each finger action by a three-letter code. The code was suitable for internal finger-action character mapping, but it took way too long to interpret when trying to execute the finger actions\nI made incremental improvements to the UI almost every time I used it. I found it very useful to indicate the next character to be typed, rather than performing the string bijection by eyeball on-the-fly.\nEach of the changes trimmed the cognitive processes I need to perform and my speed performance improved incrementally.\nI was using SVGs for the hand images and I tried indicating order by color-coding the background with various shades of green.\nI thought of using a color convention, like green for start and red for stop, but making a finger segment red is also the conventional indicator of blood. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to launch a new UI with bloody fingertips everywhere and decided it was better to avoid such connotations.\nI decided black would be the best color for stop, and that made me think of the start/stop shapes from the old cassette tape decks that continued to be used for CDs and now YouTube and online video players.\nWith the action glyphs in place I started to see significant time improvements.\nI also realized I could remove the three-letter character list that I had put so much effort into. :-( :-)\nAfter removing the three-letter chord clutter, I realized that I had all the chord images already assembled, so I could just display each one in the chord. That provided the full-chord-view that the three-letter list only pretended to do but wasn\u0026rsquo;t very useful for.\nI can look at the next chord while finishing the chord I\u0026rsquo;m on, which isn\u0026rsquo;t possible with the big hand-chord at the top which only displays one next chord.\nNow I was seeing some significant speed improvements, so I also cleaned up the clock a bit.\nWith little practice, maybe a full hour of practice, I was able to get the Sphinx pangram time down into the 30-second range.\nAround the same time, I was able to improve the PSoC logic device code. With the addition of a 10ms delay in my pin-polling switch de-bouncer, I was able to reduce sticky-key repeat and also solve a problem I was having with longer chords of 4+ finger actions per chord.\nThose improvements improved reliability. Reliability improvements are interesting because they aren\u0026rsquo;t immediately apparent. The result is just a general feeling of a nicer user experience. My training sessions just became nicer and less annoying.\nThat feeling of niceness was a little disconcerting. It probably meant I was no longer pushing myself far enough fast enough, so I decided to refactor the key mapping.\nI decided that my next target would be Vim editing, which means I need the home-row keys to be single-stroke, or single finger-action.\nThis is good. This was always where this was going to go. A one-handed keyboard implies the need for keyed navigation and editing, as well as command-line arguments.\nThe first step was just to hightlight Vim navigation keys.\nThen I went ahead and assigned \u0026lsquo;asdf\u0026rsquo; to the proximal flection of each non-thumb finger, and \u0026lsquo;jkl;\u0026rsquo; to each metacarpal interphalangeal joint flexion.\nI was a little surprised to see how much damage the key remapping did to my time performance, since I have not yet memorized character-chord mappings.\nIt looks like the new mappings, even though they are faster for common characters, require learning new hand-chord glyphs, and the glyph-to-finger-action mapping that takes place in mind-body automation requires new learning.\nEnough of the glyph-recognition training is translatable to the new chord-character mapping that I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to recover some time performance quickly.\nAll of these improvements occurred prior to my memorizing more than about 5 characters. I probably don\u0026rsquo;t even use the memorized characters when I\u0026rsquo;m reading the glyphs. It\u0026rsquo;s equivalent to having to type by looking at images of finger postions.\nOf course, that is slower than memorized character-finger-action mappings that all speed-typists have memorized and automatized into reflexive habituation.\nThese time trials were also conducted using sub-sufficient tactile switches which are creaky and require variable force depending on various environmental conditions. Some of the switches seem to require extra force before they get warmed up or something, for instance.\nThese are just some of the observations that go into estimating future use case viability for the Handex. How many ways will an improved Handex be useful? The forgoing improvements seem to indicate a vast new area which the Handex can be developed into with great advantage.\n","date":"03","image":null,"permalink":"https://handex.io/blog/time-trials/","tags":null,"title":"Time Trials"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Use this form to learn Handex chords for your favorite phrases.\nClick to load a pangram Mr. Jock, TV quiz PhD., bags few lynx.

One key element that unites many AI applications, including ChatGPT, text-to-art, and text-to-music, is the use of text input as a user interface. This article delves into the latest developments in text-to-art and text-to-music AI innovations, exploring the commonalities with ChatGPT and the incredible capacity of text to transmit and replicate complex concepts across cultures and time.\nText-to-Art AI Innovations Text-to-art AI, also known as AI-generated art, is a field where neural networks are trained to create visual art from text descriptions. DALL-E, an AI system developed by OpenAI, is a prime example of recent progress in text-to-art AI. By providing textual input to DALL-E, users can generate a wide range of artistic creations that closely match the description. This remarkable capacity to interpret and visualize complex concepts through textual input is shared with ChatGPT, which uses text to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.\nText-to-Music AI Innovations The text-to-music AI domain focuses on translating textual input into musical compositions. OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s MuseNet, for instance, can generate original music based on text prompts, including specific genres, instruments, or moods. Another example is Jukedeck, an AI-powered platform that composes custom music from user-generated textual descriptions. Like ChatGPT, these text-to-music AI systems rely on the power of text to convey intricate concepts and generate creative output.\nThe Power of Text to Transmit and Replicate Complex Concepts Text is an exceptionally versatile medium for transmitting information. It can encode complex concepts with a high degree of fidelity, allowing AI systems like ChatGPT, text-to-art, and text-to-music to generate nuanced and intricate outputs. This ability to use text as a means of communication is a testament to the expressive power of human language, which can capture a vast array of ideas and emotions.\nTextual Articulations and the Universality of Concepts The use of text as an input interface for AI applications has broad implications for the universality of concepts across different cultures and times. Text can act as a bridge, connecting people from diverse backgrounds by capturing shared human experiences and values. This is particularly true for AI-generated art and music, which often transcend cultural barriers and evoke common emotional responses.\nMoreover, the textual articulation of concepts enables AI systems like ChatGPT to adapt to users\u0026rsquo; linguistic preferences and cultural contexts, ensuring that the generated content remains relevant and engaging. This flexibility demonstrates the potential of AI to facilitate cross-cultural understanding and foster a sense of global unity through shared experiences.\nConclusion The latest AI innovations in text-to-art and text-to-music share a common feature with ChatGPT: the power of text to convey and replicate complex concepts. This capacity for textual articulation allows these AI systems to generate creative outputs that resonate with users from diverse cultural backgrounds and eras. By harnessing the universality of concepts and the expressive potential of text, AI has the potential to not only revolutionize creative industries but also promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.\n","date":"21","image":null,"permalink":"https://handex.io/blog/harnessing-the-power-of-text/","tags":["ai","art","text"],"title":"Harnessing the Power of Text: Exploring the Latest AI Innovations in Text-to-Art and Text-to-Music"},{"categories":["LifeStyle"],"contents":"The Key Board All the literature on the ergonomics of keyboards focuses on the spacing between keys and the curvature of a row of keys.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s because \u0026ldquo;key boards\u0026rdquo; have historically been thought of as keys affixed to boards.\nThe coordinate system of the key board is the X-Y coordinates used to assemble keys onto a rectangular board.\nThe biggest innovation has been to make them slightly less rectangular.\nThe Hand The Handex starts the design process way over at the other end of the device use case: The hand.\nAll the coordinates of the Handex are the coordinates based on the original coordinate system that every human starts out with, your indexable fingers, and your hand.\nThe finger coordinates are the primary experience of counting and measurement. Many unit system around the world started with fingers. They are also the infant human\u0026rsquo;s first experience of a coordinate system, when the opposable thumb measures its flexion to the opposing finger to make the pinch grip, or when all fingers role together to grasp. Even before, in the womb, it\u0026rsquo;s the first coordinated alignment of putting the thumb into the mouth, a universal human infant gesture.\nWith the hand actions of flexion, opposition, adduction and abduction being the primary initial coordinates, it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat amazing that key boards still force the hand to reorient between keystrokes to the board\u0026rsquo;s coordinate system.\nThe Handex The Handex corrects this historic misalignment by creating a device that orients every keystroke to the natural movements of the fingers. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s called a keydex instead of a key board.\nUsers of the Handex never have to look down at their hand to reposition a finger. They already know where their fingers are, which is where they have to be.\nThe Handex encorporates chorded key combinations to allow 160+ keystrokes, plus special keys.\nInitial training is aided by a training tutor that you can use at any time with your mobile device and earbuds or the screen. You can become productive on this new keydex with just 30 minutes a day of training at a leasurely and fun pace.\n","date":"20","image":null,"permalink":"https://handex.io/blog/biomechanics-of-the-hand-and-the-handex/","tags":["biomechanics","keyboard","indexable","phalanges"],"title":"Repositioning, Biomechanics of the Hand, and the Handex"},{"categories":["LifeStyle"],"contents":"Using a one-handed keydex during video game play or VR game play can offer several benefits, such as:\nIncreased Efficiency: With a keydex, players can access all the keys they need with a single hand without having to shift their hand positions, which can lead to faster and more efficient gameplay.

This can be especially beneficial for players who experience discomfort or pain when using a traditional keyboard for extended periods of time.\nIncreased Immersion: When playing in virtual reality, players may need to move and interact with objects in the game world while also navigating menus and using various inputs. A keydex can offer a seamless way to control the game without interrupting the player\u0026rsquo;s immersion by requiring them to look down or adjust their hands to access different keys.\nGreater Accessibility: For players with disabilities or mobility impairments, a one-handed keydex can be an important tool for enabling them to play games that might otherwise be difficult or impossible. By allowing them to use a single hand for all inputs, a keydex can make games more accessible and enjoyable for a wider range of players.\nOverall, a one-handed keydex can be a valuable tool for video game and VR game players, offering increased efficiency, comfort, immersion, and accessibility.\n","date":"18","image":null,"permalink":"https://handex.io/blog/using-a-one-handed-keyboard-in-gaming-vr/","tags":["gaming","vr","metaverse"],"title":"Using a One-Handed Keyboard in Gaming and VR"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Add more features and use cases here and append other feature properties.\n","date":"09","image":null,"permalink":"https://handex.io/features/","tags":null,"title":"Features"},{"categories":["mobile"],"contents":"In today\u0026rsquo;s fast-paced world, mobile devices have become an essential part of our daily lives. Whether we\u0026rsquo;re working, socializing, or simply browsing the internet, we rely on our smartphones and tablets to keep us connected and productive. However, typing on a mobile device can be a challenge, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re constantly on the go. That\u0026rsquo;s where a one-handed mobile-ready Bluetooth-enabled keyboard comes in handy. In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore the benefits of having one.\n1. Convenience One of the most significant benefits of using a one-handed mobile-ready Bluetooth-enabled keyboard is convenience. With this type of keyboard, you can easily type on your mobile device with just one hand. This is particularly useful when you\u0026rsquo;re on the move, such as when you\u0026rsquo;re commuting, standing in line, or waiting for a meeting to start. With a one-handed keyboard, you can quickly and easily respond to emails, send messages, or jot down notes without having to set down your device or use both hands.\n2. Speed Another advantage of using a one-handed mobile-ready Bluetooth-enabled keyboard is speed. Typing on a mobile device\u0026rsquo;s virtual keyboard can be slow and tedious, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not used to it. With a one-handed keyboard, you can type quickly and accurately, just as you would on a full-sized keyboard. This can be a game-changer if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to get work done on the go, as you can get more done in less time.\n3. Ergonomics Typing on a mobile device\u0026rsquo;s virtual keyboard can be awkward and uncomfortable, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re doing it for an extended period. This is because you have to hold your device in one hand and type with the other, which can strain your wrists and fingers. With a one-handed keyboard, you can type comfortably and ergonomically, as the keyboard is designed to fit comfortably in one hand. This can help prevent repetitive strain injuries and other types of discomfort associated with typing on a mobile device.\n4. Portability Another benefit of using a one-handed mobile-ready Bluetooth-enabled keyboard is portability. These keyboards are small and lightweight, which makes them easy to carry around with you wherever you go. You can slip them into your bag or pocket and take them with you on the go, so you always have a keyboard at hand when you need it. This can be particularly useful if you\u0026rsquo;re a frequent traveler, as you can use the keyboard to work on your mobile device while you\u0026rsquo;re on the move.\n5. Flexibility One of the great things about one-handed mobile-ready Bluetooth-enabled keyboards is their flexibility. You can use them with a wide range of mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets, and even smartwatches. This means that you can use the same keyboard for all your devices, which can be convenient if you use multiple devices throughout the day. Some one-handed keyboards even come with a built-in touchpad, which can be useful if you\u0026rsquo;re working on a device without a touchscreen.\n6. Accessibility For some people, typing on a mobile device\u0026rsquo;s virtual keyboard can be challenging or even impossible. This is particularly true for people with disabilities or those with conditions that affect their motor skills. A one-handed mobile-ready Bluetooth-enabled keyboard can be a lifesaver in these situations, as it allows people to type with one hand, which may be more comfortable or easier for them. This can help improve accessibility and make it easier for everyone to use mobile devices.\n","date":"24","image":null,"permalink":"https://handex.io/blog/why-mobile-keyboard/","tags":["keyboard","mobile","coding","ascii","repl"],"title":"Why Choose a One-Handed Mobile Keyboard?"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Report,Chord,Strokes a and A,4,ipf b and B,D6,\u0026ldquo;ppf, mmf\u0026rdquo;
