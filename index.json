[{"categories":["LifeStyle"],"contents":"The Key Board All the literature on the ergonomics of keyboards focuses on the spacing between keys and the curvature of a row of keys.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s because \u0026ldquo;key boards\u0026rdquo; have historically been thought of as keys affixed to boards.\nThe coordinate system of the key board is the X-Y coordinates used to assemble keys onto a rectangular board.\nThe biggest innovation has been to make them slightly less rectangular.\nThe Hand The Handex starts the design process way over at the other end of the device use case: The hand.\nAll the coordinates of the Handex are the coordinates based on the original coordinate system that every human starts out with, your indexable fingers, and your hand.\nThe finger coordinates are the primary experience of counting and measurement. Many unit system around the world started with fingers. They are also the infant human\u0026rsquo;s first experience of a coordinate system, when the opposable thumb measures its flexion to the opposing finger to make the pinch grip, or when all fingers role together to grasp. Even before, in the womb, it\u0026rsquo;s the first coordinated alignment of putting the thumb into the mouth, a universal human infant gesture.\nWith the hand actions of flexion, opposition, adduction and abduction being the primary initial coordinates, it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat amazing that key boards still force the hand to reorient between keystrokes to the board\u0026rsquo;s coordinate system.\nThe Handex The Handex corrects this historic misalignment by creating a device that orients every keystroke to the natural movements of the fingers. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s called a keydex instead of a key board.\nUsers of the Handex never have to look down at their hand to reposition a finger. They already know where their fingers are, which is where they have to be.\nThe Handex encorporates chorded key combinations to allow 160+ keystrokes, plus special keys.\nInitial training is aided by a training tutor that you can use at any time with your mobile device and earbuds or the screen. You can become productive on this new keydex with just 30 minutes a day of training at a leasurely and fun pace.\n","date":"20","image":null,"permalink":"https://handex.io/blog/biomechanics-of-the-hand-and-the-handex/","tags":["biomechanics","keyboard","indexable","phalanges"],"title":"Repositioning, Biomechanics of the Hand, and the Handex"},{"categories":["LifeStyle"],"contents":"Using a one-handed keydex during video game play or VR game play can offer several benefits, such as:\nIncreased Efficiency: With a keydex, players can access all the keys they need with a single hand without having to shift their hand positions, which can lead to faster and more efficient gameplay. This can be especially useful in games that require a lot of key inputs or quick reflexes, such as first-person shooters or real-time strategy games.\nMore Comfortable and Less Fatiguing: Using a keydex can be more comfortable for players since it allows them to maintain a natural hand position, reducing the strain on their wrists and fingers. This can be especially beneficial for players who experience discomfort or pain when using a traditional keyboard for extended periods of time.\nIncreased Immersion: When playing in virtual reality, players may need to move and interact with objects in the game world while also navigating menus and using various inputs. A keydex can offer a seamless way to control the game without interrupting the player\u0026rsquo;s immersion by requiring them to look down or adjust their hands to access different keys.\nGreater Accessibility: For players with disabilities or mobility impairments, a one-handed keydex can be an important tool for enabling them to play games that might otherwise be difficult or impossible. By allowing them to use a single hand for all inputs, a keydex can make games more accessible and enjoyable for a wider range of players.\nOverall, a one-handed keydex can be a valuable tool for video game and VR game players, offering increased efficiency, comfort, immersion, and accessibility.\n","date":"18","image":null,"permalink":"https://handex.io/blog/using-a-one-handed-keyboard-in-gaming-vr/","tags":["gaming","vr","metaverse"],"title":"Using a One-Handed Keyboard in Gaming and VR"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Add more features and use cases here and append other feature properties.\n","date":"09","image":null,"permalink":"https://handex.io/features/","tags":null,"title":"Features"},{"categories":["mobile"],"contents":"In today\u0026rsquo;s fast-paced world, mobile devices have become an essential part of our daily lives. Whether we\u0026rsquo;re working, socializing, or simply browsing the internet, we rely on our smartphones and tablets to keep us connected and productive. However, typing on a mobile device can be a challenge, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re constantly on the go. That\u0026rsquo;s where a one-handed mobile-ready Bluetooth-enabled keyboard comes in handy. In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore the benefits of having one.\n1. Convenience One of the most significant benefits of using a one-handed mobile-ready Bluetooth-enabled keyboard is convenience. With this type of keyboard, you can easily type on your mobile device with just one hand. This is particularly useful when you\u0026rsquo;re on the move, such as when you\u0026rsquo;re commuting, standing in line, or waiting for a meeting to start. With a one-handed keyboard, you can quickly and easily respond to emails, send messages, or jot down notes without having to set down your device or use both hands.\n2. Speed Another advantage of using a one-handed mobile-ready Bluetooth-enabled keyboard is speed. Typing on a mobile device\u0026rsquo;s virtual keyboard can be slow and tedious, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not used to it. With a one-handed keyboard, you can type quickly and accurately, just as you would on a full-sized keyboard. This can be a game-changer if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to get work done on the go, as you can get more done in less time.\n3. Ergonomics Typing on a mobile device\u0026rsquo;s virtual keyboard can be awkward and uncomfortable, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re doing it for an extended period. This is because you have to hold your device in one hand and type with the other, which can strain your wrists and fingers. With a one-handed keyboard, you can type comfortably and ergonomically, as the keyboard is designed to fit comfortably in one hand. This can help prevent repetitive strain injuries and other types of discomfort associated with typing on a mobile device.\n4. Portability Another benefit of using a one-handed mobile-ready Bluetooth-enabled keyboard is portability. These keyboards are small and lightweight, which makes them easy to carry around with you wherever you go. You can slip them into your bag or pocket and take them with you on the go, so you always have a keyboard at hand when you need it. This can be particularly useful if you\u0026rsquo;re a frequent traveler, as you can use the keyboard to work on your mobile device while you\u0026rsquo;re on the move.\n5. Flexibility One of the great things about one-handed mobile-ready Bluetooth-enabled keyboards is their flexibility. You can use them with a wide range of mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets, and even smartwatches. This means that you can use the same keyboard for all your devices, which can be convenient if you use multiple devices throughout the day. Some one-handed keyboards even come with a built-in touchpad, which can be useful if you\u0026rsquo;re working on a device without a touchscreen.\n6. Accessibility For some people, typing on a mobile device\u0026rsquo;s virtual keyboard can be challenging or even impossible. This is particularly true for people with disabilities or those with conditions that affect their motor skills. A one-handed mobile-ready Bluetooth-enabled keyboard can be a lifesaver in these situations, as it allows people to type with one hand, which may be more comfortable or easier for them. This can help improve accessibility and make it easier for everyone to use mobile devices.\n","date":"24","image":null,"permalink":"https://handex.io/blog/why-mobile-keyboard/","tags":["keyboard","mobile","coding","ascii","repl"],"title":"Why Choose a One-Handed Mobile Keyboard?"},{"categories":["LifeStyle"],"contents":"Almost every day for the past nine or so months has felt like March 13, and that can sometimes make it difficult to want to wake up for the day ahead of you.\nTo make a morning person out of you, the wake-up light simulates the sunrise to gradually ease you awake.
