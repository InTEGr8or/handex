</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>The Hero: A scientist who is working to stop the spread of a zombie-like contagion that is threatening the population.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>The Problem: The contagion is spreading rapidly and the scientist is struggling to keep up with the data and analysis required to understand and contain it.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>The Guide: The Bluetooth-enabled one-handed typing device, which allows the scientist to input data and analyze it more quickly and efficiently.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>

</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Armageddon&#34;</span>: This movie follows a team of astronauts and oil drillers as they work to stop an asteroid from colliding with Earth.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Outbreak&#34;</span>: In this movie, a team of scientists and medical professionals must work to contain and cure a deadly virus that has been released in a small town.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;The Core&#34;</span>: This movie follows a team of scientists and engineers as they work to stop the Earth<span style=color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010>&#39;</span>s core from stopping, which would lead to the destruction of the planet.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;28 Days Later&#34;</span>: In this movie, a team of scientists and medical professionals must work to stop a virus that turns people into aggressive, zombie-like creatures.

</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>These are just a few examples of movies that involve people working in these fields dealing with an imminent crisis. There are many other movies that explore similar themes and scenarios.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So it could be a funny advertisement if we just pulled a high stress moment from one of these movies, change the plot so that the fate of the world is dependent on the input of this data into a smartphone, and the user is having problems doing it quickly and accurately. Then the guide presents the answer, etc.
