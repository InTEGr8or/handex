title: Why is a kedex better than a keyboard?
---

The Handex is not a key "board" because it is not built on the concept of a flat board with keys attached. It's designed around the shape of your hand and the flexion of your philanges. You never have to reposition your fingers to the coordinates of a board, so you'll never have to look down at your hand.
