The Hero: A stone age era caveman who works in a control room within a cave, but is feeling trapped and unfulfilled in his job.

The Problem: The caveman is convinced that the control room is an environment that controls him as much as he commands the controls, and he feels that his ability to think creatively is blocked and his body is slowly withering.

The Guide: A neighbor who works out in the field collecting information for the tribe and has discovered a new way of working that allows him to be more productive and fulfilled.

The Plan: The guide introduces the caveman to the Bluetooth-enabled one-handed typing device, which allows him to input data and execute commands more quickly and efficiently using just one hand.

The Battle: The caveman must overcome his skepticism and fear of change as he learns to use the new device and adapts to a new way of working.

The Victory: By using the Bluetooth-enabled one-handed typing device, the caveman is able to work more efficiently and feel more fulfilled in his job. He also discovers that the control room is not as controlling as he had thought, and that he has more freedom and creativity in his work than he realized.

The Moral: With the right tools and an open mind, anyone can break free from feeling trapped in their job and discover new opportunities for growth and fulfillment.

Alex: We talked a bit about what kind of professions work in the field and use a smart phone as their primary data input device. It gave me a list a professions, and then I asked it to give me a list of movies where one of these professions deal with an imminent crisis:

```sh
Here are a few movies that involve people working in the fields listed above (environmental, construction/engineering, data collection, medical, and agricultural) dealing with an imminent crisis:

"Contagion": This movie follows a team of scientists and medical professionals as they work to contain and understand a deadly virus that is spreading rapidly around the world.

"The Day After Tomorrow": In this movie, a team of scientists must work to stop a global catastrophe caused by climate change.

"Armageddon": This movie follows a team of astronauts and oil drillers as they work to stop an asteroid from colliding with Earth.

"Outbreak": In this movie, a team of scientists and medical professionals must work to contain and cure a deadly virus that has been released in a small town.

"The Core": This movie follows a team of scientists and engineers as they work to stop the Earth's core from stopping, which would lead to the destruction of the planet.

"28 Days Later": In this movie, a team of scientists and medical professionals must work to stop a virus that turns people into aggressive, zombie-like creatures.

"Waterworld": This movie follows a group of survivors who are trying to find land in a world where the polar ice caps have melted and the earth is covered in water.

"The Martian": In this movie, an astronaut is stranded on Mars and must use his scientific expertise to survive and find a way to get back to Earth.

These are just a few examples of movies that involve people working in these fields dealing with an imminent crisis. There are many other movies that explore similar themes and scenarios.
```

So it could be a funny advertisement if we just pulled a high stress moment from one of these movies, change the plot so that the fate of the world is dependent on the input of this data into a smartphone, and the user is having problems doing it quickly and accurately. Then the guide presents the answer, etc.
