Caveman's mind is frustrated and his body is withering.

The villain is the sedentary lifestyle.

Handex takes the caveman out of the "control room" (cave). They can control their creations without their environment in turn controlling the creator.

When inspiration strikes, Handex is there.

* a chair
* a room
