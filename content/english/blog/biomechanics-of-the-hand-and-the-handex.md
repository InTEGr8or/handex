## The Key Board

All the literature on the ergonomics of keyboards focuses on the spacing between keys and the curvature of a row of keys.

That's because "key boards" have historically been thought of as keys affixed to boards. 

The coordinate system of the key board is the X-Y coordinates used to assemble keys onto a rectangular board. 

The biggest innovation has been to make them slightly less rectangular.

## The Hand

The Handex starts the design process _way_ over at the other end of the device use case: The hand.

All the coordinates of the Handex are the coordinates based on the original coordinate system that every human starts out with, your indexable fingers, and your hand.

The finger coordinates are the primary experience of counting and measurement. Many unit system around the world started with fingers. They are also the infant human's first experience of a coordinate system, when the opposable thumb measures its flexion to the opposing finger to make the pinch grip, or when all fingers role together to grasp. Even before, in the womb, it's the first coordinated alignment of putting the thumb into the mouth, a universal human infant gesture.

With the hand actions of flexion, opposition, adduction and abduction being the primary initial coordinates, it's somewhat amazing that key boards still force the hand to reorient between keystrokes to the board's coordinate system.

## The Handex

The Handex corrects this historic misalignment by creating a device that orients every keystroke to the natural movements of the fingers. That's why it's called a keydex instead of a key board.

Users of the Handex never have to look down at their hand to reposition a finger. They already know where their fingers are, which is where they have to be.

The Handex encorporates chorded key combinations to allow 160+ keystrokes, plus special keys.

Initial training is aided by a training tutor that you can use at any time with your mobile device and earbuds or the screen. You can become productive on this new keydex with just 30 minutes a day training at a leasurely and fun pace.
