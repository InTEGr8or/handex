# The Future of Ergonomic Keyboards

In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the importance of ergonomics in our daily lives, especially when it comes to our working environment. One area where we have seen significant advancements in ergonomic design is the humble keyboard. With more and more people spending hours each day typing away at their computers, it's no wonder that manufacturers are constantly looking for ways to improve comfort and efficiency.## Understanding the Different Types of Ergonomic Keyboards

Ergonomic keyboards come in a variety of shapes and designs, each with its own unique features. One common type is the split keyboard, which allows the user to position the two halves of the keyboard at a comfortable distance apart.
