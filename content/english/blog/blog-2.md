Using a one-handed keydex during video game play or VR game play can offer several benefits, such as:

Increased Efficiency: With a keydex, players can access all the keys they need with a single hand without having to shift their hand positions, which can lead to faster and more efficient gameplay. This can be especially useful in games that require a lot of key inputs or quick reflexes, such as first-person shooters or real-time strategy games.

More Comfortable and Less Fatiguing: Using a keydex can be more comfortable for players since it allows them to maintain a natural hand position, reducing the strain on their wrists and fingers. This can be especially beneficial for players who experience discomfort or pain when using a traditional keyboard for extended periods of time.

Increased Immersion: When playing in virtual reality, players may need to move and interact with objects in the game world while also navigating menus and using various inputs. A keydex can offer a seamless way to control the game without interrupting the player's immersion by requiring them to look down or adjust their hands to access different keys.

Greater Accessibility: For players with disabilities or mobility impairments, a one-handed keydex can be an important tool for enabling them to play games that might otherwise be difficult or impossible. By allowing them to use a single hand for all inputs, a keydex can make games more accessible and enjoyable for a wider range of players.

Overall, a one-handed keydex can be a valuable tool for video game and VR game players, offering increased efficiency, comfort, immersion, and accessibility.
