summary: The user asked how to start using TypeScript in their Hugo static website and mentioned Hugo's `js.build()` function. The assistant explained that while Hugo does not natively support TypeScript transpilation, they can leverage Vite's TypeScript support through the `vite-hugo-plugin`. The assistant provided steps to install TypeScript, configure Vite, write TypeScript code, adjust Hugo configuration, and ensure the build process handles TypeScript transpilation. Finally, the assistant shared an updated snippet of the Vite configuration with the `vite-hugo-plugin` included.

I would like to start using TypeScript in my Hugo static website. I think that requires a method of transpiling the TypeScript into JavaScript and I think Hugo has a tool called `js.build()` that can do that But I'm not sure if that's what it does.

How can I start using TypeScript in my Hugo static website?

To use TypeScript in your Hugo static website, you'll indeed need to transpile TypeScript into JavaScript. While Hugo has built-in support for transpiling JavaScript with `js.Build()`, as of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, it does not natively support TypeScript transpilation. 

However, since you are using Vite with the `vite-hugo-plugin`, you can leverage Vite's TypeScript support to transpile your TypeScript files into JavaScript. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Install TypeScript**: If you haven't already, install TypeScript in your project:
   ```bash
   npm install typescript --save-dev
   ```

2. **Configure Vite**: Ensure that Vite is configured to handle TypeScript. This is usually done automatically when you create a Vite project, but you can also add a TypeScript plugin if necessary. Since you're already using `@preact/preset-vite`, TypeScript support might be included there.

3. **Write TypeScript**: Start writing your scripts using TypeScript (`.ts` files) in your assets directory.

4. **Adjust Hugo Configuration**: If necessary, update your Hugo configuration to ignore the TypeScript source files and only use the transpiled JavaScript files.

5. **Build Process**: When you run your build process, Vite will handle the transpilation of TypeScript to JavaScript.

Here is an updated snippet of your Vite configuration to include the `vite-hugo-plugin` and ensure it's properly configured:

```typescript
import { resolve } from 'path';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import preact from '@preact/preset-vite';
import hugoPlugin from 'vite-hugo-plugin';

const appDir = __dirname; // Root directory of our application
const distDir = resolve(appDir, 'dist'); // The directory where Hugo builds its files
const hugoConfigFileName = 'config/_default/config.toml'; // Path to your Hugo config

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    preact(),
    hugoPlugin({
      hugoOutDir: distDir,
      appDir,
      hugoConfigFileName
    }),
    // ... You can add more plugins if needed
  ],
  // ... The rest of your Vite configuration
});
```

Remember to run Vite's build process before Hugo's build process, so that the TypeScript files are transpiled into JavaScript and ready for Hugo to include in the final build.

Keep in mind that this response is based on the information available up to early 2023, and tooling or best practices may have evolved since then. If there are new developments in Hugo's TypeScript support, you would need to check the latest documentation or community resources.
