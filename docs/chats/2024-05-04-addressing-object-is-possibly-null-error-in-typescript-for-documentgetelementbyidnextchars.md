summary: The user asked for help with the error "Object is possibly 'null'." in TypeScript related to `document.getElementById('nextChars')`. I explained that this error occurs because the `getElementById` method can return `null` if the element with the specified ID is not found in the DOM. I provided solutions to address this issue, including performing a null check on the result or using a non-null assertion operator (`!`) if certain the element exists in the DOM.

The issue "Object is possibly 'null'." in TypeScript on the line `document.getElementById('nextChars')` occurs because `getElementById` can return `null` if the element with the specified ID is not found in the DOM. To address this, you can perform a null check on the result of `getElementById` or use a non-null assertion operator (`!`) if you are certain that the element exists in the DOM.

Here's how you can address it with a null check:

```typescript
const nextCharsElement = document.getElementById('nextChars');
if (nextCharsElement) {
    // Work with nextCharsElement here
}
```

Or if you are sure the element exists, you can use a non-null assertion operator:

```typescript
const nextCharsElement = document.getElementById('nextChars')!;
// Work with nextCharsElement here
``` 

By performing this null check or using the non-null assertion operator, you can avoid the "Object is possibly 'null'." error.
