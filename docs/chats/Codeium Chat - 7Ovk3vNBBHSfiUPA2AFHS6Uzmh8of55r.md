I am having trouble getting TypeScript debugging to work in VS Code. I need your help troubleshooting the problem.

Let's try to focus on any cli commands I can run to check the setup, or any other definite steps I can take.

---

**Codeium** _at 5:50 pm, May 1, 2024_

Certainly! Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot TypeScript debugging in VS Code:

1. **Check TypeScript Version**:
   Make sure you are using a compatible TypeScript version. Run the following command to check the installed TypeScript version:
   ```bash
   tsc --version
   ```
   Or, if you are using a local TypeScript version in your project:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --version
   ```

2. **Check `tsconfig.json`**:
   Ensure that your `tsconfig.json` has the `sourceMap` option enabled so that source maps are generated, which are necessary for debugging:
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "sourceMap": true
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Launch Configuration**:
   Check your `.vscode/launch.json` file for the correct debug configuration. An example configuration for debugging TypeScript might look like this:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "0.2.0",
     "configurations": [
       {
         "type": "node",
         "request": "launch",
         "name": "Launch Program",
         "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/index.ts",
         "preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - tsconfig.json",
         "outFiles": [
           "${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"
         ],
         "sourceMaps": true
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   Ensure that the `program` points to the TypeScript entry file and `outFiles` matches the location of the generated JavaScript files.

4. **Build the Project**:
   Before debugging, you need to compile your TypeScript files to JavaScript. You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   tsc
   ```
   Or, if you have a build script defined in your `package.json`, you could run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Check for Compilation Errors**:
   If there are compilation errors, they may prevent the debugger from attaching properly. Run the TypeScript compiler and check for any errors:
   ```bash
   tsc --noEmit
   ```
   This will compile the TypeScript files without emitting JavaScript, just to check for errors.

6. **Verify Debugger Attach**:
   If you have followed the previous steps and started the debugger, but it's not attaching, ensure that no other processes are running on the same port and that your application is indeed waiting for the debugger to attach.

7. **Check Breakpoints**:
   Ensure that the breakpoints you set are not grayed out. If they are, it could mean that the source maps are not correctly linked or that the debugger does not recognize the source code.

8. **Inspect the Debug Console**:
   The Debug Console in VS Code can provide you with useful information about errors or issues that occur during debugging. Check if there are any error messages or warnings.

9. **Update VS Code and Extensions**:
   Sometimes issues can be resolved by simply updating to the latest version of VS Code and its extensions.

If after following these steps you still encounter issues, please provide specific error messages or behaviors you're observing, and we can dive deeper into the problem.

I get this:

```ps1

Version 5.4.5
```

I have this in my `tsconfig.json`

```json
  "sourceMap": true,                /* Create source map files for emitted JavaScript files. */
```

and I have this in my `launch.json`

```json

      "sourceMaps": true,
      "pathMapping": {
        "/": "${workspaceFolder}/static"
      },
      "resolveSourceMapLocations": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/assets/ts",
        "${workspaceFolder}/static"
      ],
      "sourceMapPathOverrides": {
        "webpack:///../../assets/ts/*": "${webRoot}/assets/ts/*"
      }
    },
```

Given the information you provided, your TypeScript version and `tsconfig.json` configuration seem to be correct. The `launch.json` configuration also looks appropriate for debugging TypeScript in a Hugo project using Microsoft Edge.

However, there are a few additional steps and checks we can perform to ensure that debugging is set up correctly:

1. **Compile TypeScript**:
   Make sure you compile your TypeScript files into JavaScript and generate the source maps. Run the TypeScript compiler with:
   ```bash
   npx tsc
   ```
   Check the output directory to ensure that `.js` and `.js.map` files are generated.

2. **Ensure Hugo is Serving**:
   Before launching the debugger, make sure that your Hugo server is running and serving the static files. You can start Hugo with:
   ```bash
   hugo serve
   ```

3. **Verify Source Map Path Overrides**:
   Check the `sourceMapPathOverrides` setting in `launch.json`. It should correctly map the source map paths to your project's structure. The configuration you posted attempts to resolve paths for assets that Webpack bundles. Make sure the override pattern correctly matches the structure of the generated source maps.

4. **Check for Errors in Developer Tools**:
   After launching the debugger, open the Developer Tools in Microsoft Edge (F12) and check the Console and Sources tabs for any errors regarding source maps or loading of TypeScript files.

5. **Check Network Activity**:
   In the Developer Tools' Network tab, look for the `.js.map` files to confirm they are being served by Hugo and are accessible.

6. **Verify Debugger is Attaching**:
   When you start the debugging session, ensure that VS Code successfully attaches to Edge. If not, there might be an issue with the debugger extension or the configuration.

7. **Start with a Clean State**:
   Close all instances of Microsoft Edge and VS Code, and then restart VS Code. Try to launch a new debugging session to see if the issue persists.

8. **Check the Debugger Extension**:
   Ensure that the Debugger for Microsoft Edge extension is installed and updated in VS Code.

If you've checked all of these and the issue still persists, consider the following:

- The path in `pathMapping` and `sourceMapPathOverrides` might need adjustments depending on your project's directory structure.
- Ensure that no other process is using the same port as Hugo's local server (port 1313).
- If you have custom build processes or tasks in your `package.json`, make sure they are completing successfully.

If the above steps do not resolve the issue, please provide any specific error messages or describe the behavior you're seeing in more detail for further assistance.

The breakpoints are gray donuts instead of red disks

---

**Codeium** _at 5:58 pm, May 1, 2024_

Gray breakpoints in VS Code usually indicate that the debugger is not able to map the source code in your editor to the transpiled code that is actually running. This is often due to issues with source maps. Here’s what you can do to resolve this:

1. **Check Source Maps**:
   Verify that the `.js.map` files are generated in the correct output directory and that they are accessible when the server is running.

2. **Correct Source Map References**:
   Make sure that the generated JavaScript files contain the correct references to the source map files. At the end of the `.js` files, you should see a comment like:
   ```javascript
   //# sourceMappingURL=file.js.map
   ```
   The path specified should correctly point to the `.js.map` file relative to the `.js` file.

3. **Check `sourceMapPathOverrides`**:
   The `sourceMapPathOverrides` in your `launch.json` might need to be adjusted. This setting tells the debugger how to find the TypeScript files from the source map data. You should ensure that the structure it defines matches your project's directory structure. For example:
   ```json
   "sourceMapPathOverrides": {
     "webpack:///./assets/ts/*": "${webRoot}/assets/ts/*"
   }
   ```
   It’s important that the left side of the mapping matches the paths found in the `.js.map` files, and the right side maps to the actual location of the TypeScript files in your project.

4. **Path Consistency**:
   Ensure that the paths in `resolveSourceMapLocations` and `pathMapping` in your `launch.json` are correct and are consistent with the actual paths in your project.

5. **Check `webRoot` Setting**:
   The `webRoot` setting in your `launch.json` should match the root directory of your project from where the paths are resolved.

6. **Clear Cached Source Maps**:
   Browsers can cache source maps. Clear the cache in Microsoft Edge to ensure that it is loading the latest source map files.

7. **Debug Console Output**:
   Start a debug session, and carefully look at the output in the Debug Console in VS Code. It might provide clues as to why the source maps are not being correctly interpreted.

8. **Rebuild the Project**:
   Sometimes, simply rebuilding the project can resolve the issue. Make sure to clean out the old `.js` and `.js.map` files and then recompile the TypeScript files.

9. **Restart VS Code**:
   Close VS Code and reopen it. This can sometimes resolve issues where the debugger is not properly loaded.

10. **Update Extensions**:
    Ensure that all related VS Code extensions, particularly the Debugger for Microsoft Edge extension, are up-to-date.

11. **Check for Typos**:
    Double-check your `launch.json` for any typos or incorrect paths that could be causing the source maps to be misinterpreted.

If after checking these things, you still have gray breakpoints, please provide more details about the directory structure of your TypeScript and compiled JavaScript files, or any other information that could help in troubleshooting the issue further.

**User** _at 6:02 pm, May 1, 2024_

Can you explain this part? `"webpack:///./assets/ts/*"`

---

**Codeium** _at 6:03 pm, May 1, 2024_

Certainly! The `"webpack:///./assets/ts/*"` part in the `sourceMapPathOverrides` setting within your `launch.json` file is a pattern used to map the paths of the source files as they are referenced inside the source maps to the actual paths on your filesystem where those source files reside.

When you use a bundler like Webpack, it often transforms the file paths in the source maps it generates. For example, it might prefix them with a protocol-like string such as `webpack://`. This can cause confusion for the debugger because the file paths in the source maps no longer match the actual file paths on your disk.

Here's what each part means:

- `webpack://`: This is a virtual protocol used by Webpack. It doesn't correspond to an actual network protocol but is used within source maps to refer to the bundled source.

- `./`: This indicates a relative path from some base directory that Webpack considers the root. It is relative to the context directory specified in the Webpack configuration.

- `/assets/ts/*`: This is the path within the Webpack bundle that corresponds to the actual location of your TypeScript files. The `*` is a wildcard that matches any file within this path.

In the `sourceMapPathOverrides`, you're creating a mapping:

```json
"webpack:///./assets/ts/*": "${webRoot}/assets/ts/*"
```

This tells the debugger that whenever it sees a path in a source map that starts with `webpack:///./assets/ts/`, it should map this to the corresponding path in your project's file system `${webRoot}/assets/ts/`. Here `${webRoot}` is a variable in `launch.json` that should be set to the directory that serves as the root for your web server (often the root of your project).

The purpose of this override is to ensure that the debugger can correctly resolve the source files referenced in the source maps to the actual source files on your disk, allowing it to correctly match the running code to the source files for debugging purposes. If the paths don't match up, you'll end up with gray breakpoints because the debugger can't locate the original TypeScript files based on the information in the source maps.

```

What can I run or test to find out where the debugger is looking for the source maps, or why they are failing to attach the breakpoints?

---

**Codeium** _at 8:27 pm, May 1, 2024_

To find out where the debugger is looking for the source maps and why it might be failing to correctly attach the breakpoints, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check the `.js.map` File Content**:
   Open one of the `.js.map` files, such as `HandexTerm.js.map`, and check the `"sources"` field to see what path it provides for the original TypeScript file. This can give you a clue as to how the path is being resolved.

2. **Debugging with Source Map Information**:
   Since you are debugging a TypeScript project in a browser environment using VS Code, you can use the `trace` option in your `launch.json` to get more detailed information about what the debugger is doing. Add the following lines to the configuration you want to investigate:
   ```json
   {
     "trace": true
   }
   ```
   This will output detailed diagnostic information about the debugger's activities to the `Debug Console` in VS Code, including how it's trying to resolve source maps.

3. **Check the Developer Tools in Edge**:
   Inspect the `Sources` tab in the Edge Developer Tools (F12) when your local server is running. Look for the `.ts` files under the file tree. If they are not there, it likely means the source maps are not being correctly interpreted by the browser.

4. **Check the Network Tab**:
   In the Developer Tools, go to the `Network` tab and refresh your page. Look for the `.js.map` files to check if they are being requested and successfully loaded. If they are not, there might be an issue with the path or the server configuration.

5. **Console Output for Source Map Errors**:
   Look at the console in the Developer Tools for any errors or warnings related to source maps. Sometimes, the browser will log issues that can help you pinpoint the issue.

6. **Review the `launch.json` Configuration**:
   Make sure your `launch.json` source map settings are correct. Given your project structure, you might need to adjust your `sourceMapPathOverrides` to reflect the actual path mapping between your source `.ts` files and the compiled `.js.map` files. For example:
   ```json
   "sourceMapPathOverrides": {
     "webpack:///./assets/ts/*": "${workspaceFolder}/assets/ts/*"
   }
   ```
   Adjust the left side of the mapping (`webpack:///./assets/ts/*`) to match the `"sources"` content in your `.js.map` files.

By following these steps, you should be able to get more insight into the problem and potentially resolve the issue with the gray breakpoints. If you are still facing issues, please share the diagnostic output or any relevant error messages for further assistance.

**User** _at 8:28 pm, May 1, 2024_

For item 1 I see this:

```json
"file":"HandexTerm.js","sourceRoot":"","sources":["../../../assets/ts/terminal/HandexTerm.ts"],"names":[],
```

---

**Codeium** _at 8:28 pm, May 1, 2024_

The `"sources"` field in your `HandexTerm.js.map` file indicates that the source map is referencing the original TypeScript file with a relative path that goes up three directories from the location of the `.js.map` file and then into the `assets/ts/terminal` directory.

Given the structure you've shown, your `.js.map` files are in `static/js/terminal`, so the relative path `../../../assets/ts/terminal/HandexTerm.ts` is likely correct, as it goes up to the root of your project and then into the `assets/ts/terminal` directory where your TypeScript source file `HandexTerm.ts` is located.

To match this in your `launch.json`, your `sourceMapPathOverrides` might need to be adjusted. Based on the relative path provided in the source map, you could try the following override:

```json
"sourceMapPathOverrides": {
  "webpack:///../../../assets/ts/terminal/*": "${workspaceFolder}/assets/ts/terminal/*"
}
```

This tells the debugger to map paths from the source map that look like `webpack:///../../../assets/ts/terminal/HandexTerm.ts` to the actual path on your filesystem, starting from the `${workspaceFolder}` and appending the `/assets/ts/terminal/HandexTerm.ts` path.

To diagnose further, let’s proceed with step 2:

2. **Enable Trace Logging**:
   Add the `trace` option to your `launch.json` configuration to get detailed diagnostic information about the debugger's activities:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "msedge",
     "request": "launch",
     // ... other configuration options
     "trace": "verbose"
   }
   ```
   After adding `trace`, start a debugging session and look at the output in the Debug Console in VS Code for messages about source map processing.

After making these changes, try running the debugger again and check if the breakpoints now correctly bind (turn from gray to red). If they are still gray, please check the Debug Console for any output related to the source map resolution and share it for further assistance.

---

**User** _at 8:34 pm, May 1, 2024_

The debug console outputs this:

```
Verbose logs are written to:

```

---

**Codeium** _at 8:34 pm, May 1, 2024_

The output from the Debug Console doesn't seem to provide specific information about source map processing. Let's try the following steps to continue troubleshooting:

1. **Examine the Trace Log**:
   The verbose logs are written to a file on your system as indicated in the output. Open the log file located at:
   ```
   c:\Users\xgenx\AppData\Roaming\Code - Insiders\logs\20240501T143246\window1\exthost\ms-vscode.js-debug\vscode-debugadapter-5535deca.json.gz
   ```
   You will need to unzip the `.gz` file to view the log. This log should contain detailed information about the debugging session, including how source maps are being processed. Look for entries related to source map resolution and see if there are any issues or errors reported.

2. **Check the Path Overrides**:
   Given the source map content you shared earlier, it's possible that the `sourceMapPathOverrides` in your `launch.json` needs to be updated. Since the source map indicates a relative path from the location of the `.js.map` file back to the source `.ts` file, the override should account for this. Try updating your `sourceMapPathOverrides` to match the relative path. Given the directory structure and the relative path in the source map, you may not need a complex override pattern. You could try a simple mapping like this:
   ```json
   "sourceMapPathOverrides": {
     "webpack:///*": "${workspaceFolder}/*"
   }
   ```
   This override assumes that the source map's relative paths should be resolved from the workspace root. Adjust as necessary based on your specific setup.

3. **Recompile and Restart**:
   Make sure to recompile your TypeScript code after changing the `tsconfig.json` or any other configuration files. Then restart the VS Code debugger to ensure it picks up the latest source maps.

4. **Check for Errors in the Browser**:
   Open the Developer Tools in Microsoft Edge, go to the `Sources` tab, and check if your original TypeScript files are listed there. If they are, try setting breakpoints directly in the Developer Tools to see if they are hit. This can help determine if the issue is with the source maps themselves or with the integration between VS Code and the browser.

If after following these steps you still have issues with gray breakpoints, please provide any relevant information from the trace log, or any new error messages you encounter, for further assistance.

**User** _at 8:45 pm, May 1, 2024_

This:

```ts
   for (let i = 0; i < commandHistory.length; i++) {
    this.outputElement.appendChild(commandHistory[i]);
   }
```

is giving me this: `
main.js:7066  
Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'`

Because `commandHistory` is a `HTMLElement[]`

How can I fix that?

---

**Codeium** _at 8:46 pm, May 1, 2024_

The error suggests that one or more elements in your `commandHistory` array are not of type `Node`, which is required by the `appendChild` method. The `appendChild` method is expecting each item to be a DOM node, but it seems that might not be the case for all elements within your `commandHistory` array.

To fix the issue, you should ensure that all elements in the `commandHistory` array are indeed DOM nodes (e.g., instances of `HTMLElement` or other node types). If there's a possibility that some elements might not be DOM nodes, you may need to add a check before attempting to append them to the `outputElement`.

Here's how you can add a check to ensure that each element is a `Node`:

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < commandHistory.length; i++) {
  const element = commandHistory[i];
  if (element instanceof Node) {
    this.outputElement.appendChild(element);
  } else {
    console.error('Element is not a Node:', element);
    // Handle the case where the element is not a Node, if needed.
  }
}
```

If you're confident that all items should already be DOM nodes, then you may need to investigate why an element of another type is getting into the `commandHistory` array. This could involve inspecting the code where `commandHistory` is populated to ensure that only DOM nodes are being added to the array.
