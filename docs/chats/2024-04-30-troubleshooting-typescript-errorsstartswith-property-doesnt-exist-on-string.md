Explain problem: `Property 'startsWith' does not exist on type 'string'. Do you need to change your target library? Try changing the 'lib' compiler option to 'es2015' or later.`

The error "Property 'startsWith' does not exist on type 'string'" occurs because the `startsWith` method is not available in the target TypeScript library that is being used. To resolve this issue, you can change the `lib` compiler option to include 'es2015' or a later version.

You can update your `tsconfig.json` file to include the 'es2015' lib in the `compilerOptions` section like this:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["es2015"]
  }
}
```

By adding 'es2015' to the `lib` option, TypeScript will include the necessary type definitions for the `startsWith` method, allowing you to use it without the compilation error.

**User** _at 11:29 am, Apr 30, 2024_

I currently have this:

```json
  "target": "es2016",                 /* Set the JavaScript language version for emitted JavaScript and include compatible library declarations. */
  "lib": ["DOM","ESNext"],                    /* Specify a set of bundled library declaration files that describe the target runtime environment. */
```

is that wrong?

---

**Codeium** _at 11:29 am, Apr 30, 2024_

No, your configuration is not wrong. If you have `"target": "es2016"` in your `tsconfig.json`, it means the emitted JavaScript is supposed to be compatible with ECMAScript 2016 standards, which includes the `startsWith` method on strings. Additionally, specifying `"lib": ["DOM", "ESNext"]` means that you're including the latest ECMAScript features along with DOM type definitions.

The `startsWith` method was introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), so with your current configuration, you should not be getting the error that `startsWith` does not exist on type 'string'. If you are still experiencing this issue, it could be due to a few other reasons:

1. Your TypeScript compiler might not be using the `tsconfig.json` you expect. Make sure that the configuration file is correctly named and located in the root directory of your project or that your build tool is correctly pointed to it.

2. Your IDE or editor might be using a different TypeScript version than what your project is set to use. Check that your IDE is configured to use the project's local TypeScript version.

3. The error might be generated by stale or incorrect type information. Try restarting your TypeScript server or your IDE.

If none of these suggestions solve the issue, you might want to check if there's a specific setup in your project that's causing the TypeScript type checker to not recognize the `startsWith` method on strings.

**User** _at 11:36 am, Apr 30, 2024_

I tried restarting `npm start` and restarting VS Code, but I'm still getting the problem.

This is a Hugo static site with TypeScript and node modules.

**Codeium** _at 11:37 am, Apr 30, 2024_

Given your setup and the fact that you're still experiencing the issue after restarting your services and VS Code, let's try the following steps to troubleshoot the problem:

1. Ensure TypeScript is correctly installed in your project by running:
   ```bash
   npm install typescript --save-dev
   ```

2. Double-check your `tsconfig.json` file to ensure it's properly configured and located in the root of your project.

3. Since you are using VS Code, open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and type "TypeScript: Select TypeScript version". Make sure that VS Code is using the workspace version of TypeScript, which should be the version installed in your `node_modules` directory.

4. Run the TypeScript compiler directly from the command line to check if the issue persists. You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   npx tsc
   ```
   This will use the TypeScript compiler from your `node_modules` folder to compile your project according to your `tsconfig.json` settings.

5. If you're using third-party libraries, make sure they are installed and their types are available. For some libraries, you might need to install types separately using DefinitelyTyped. For example:
   ```bash
   npm install @types/{library_name} --save-dev
   ```

6. Clear the npm cache and reinstall your `node_modules`:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   npm install
   ```

7. Check if there is any custom TypeScript build configuration or script in your package.json that might be causing the issue.

If you've tried all these steps and the issue still persists, it might be helpful to look at the specific error message and stack trace, if available, to get more context on why the `startsWith` method isn't being recognized. 

Please ensure that the `startsWith` method is being called on a string variable. If `localStorage.key(i)` returns `null` or `undefined`, then TypeScript will fail to compile since `startsWith` cannot be called on those types. You've correctly used optional chaining (`?.`) to prevent calling `startsWith` on `null` or `undefined`, but make sure that every usage of `startsWith` in your codebase follows this pattern.

When I run `npx tsc` I get this error:

```
assets/ts/terminal/HandexTerm.ts:22:11 - error TS2564: Property 'wpmCalculator' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.

22  private wpmCalculator: IWPMCalculator;
```

---

**Codeium** _at 11:43 am, Apr 30, 2024_

The error you're seeing when you run `npx tsc` is not related to the `startsWith` issue but is another TypeScript error indicating that the `wpmCalculator` property must be initialized before it can be used.

In TypeScript, if the `--strictPropertyInitialization` flag is enabled (which is part of the `--strict` flag), class properties must be initialized either where they are declared or in the constructor.

Here's how you can resolve this issue:

1. **Initialize the property where it's declared:**
   ```typescript
   private wpmCalculator: IWPMCalculator = new WPMCalculator();
   ```
   (Replace `new WPMCalculator()` with the appropriate initialization for your use case.)

2. **Initialize the property in the constructor:**
   ```typescript
   constructor() {
     this.wpmCalculator = new WPMCalculator();
     // other initializations
   }
   ```
   (Again, replace `new WPMCalculator()` with the appropriate initialization.)

3. **Use the Non-Null Assertion Operator (if you are sure the property will be assigned before any usage):**
   ```typescript
   private wpmCalculator!: IWPMCalculator;
   ```

4. **Make the property optional if it's not guaranteed to be initialized immediately:**
   ```typescript
   private wpmCalculator?: IWPMCalculator;
   ```

Choose the option that best fits your class logic. If you're initializing `wpmCalculator` outside of the constructor and before it's ever used, the Non-Null Assertion Operator can be used. However, if it can be `undefined` for a period of time, then marking it as optional is safer. If it should always be initialized, then either provide a default value where it's declared or initialize it in the constructor.

Ok, now with `npx tsc` I get no errors, but I still see the problem with 

```
roperty 'startsWith' does not exist on type 'string'. Do you need to change your target library? Try changing the 'lib' compiler option to 'es2015' or later.ts(2550)
```

---

**Codeium** _at 11:55 am, Apr 30, 2024_

Since running `npx tsc` doesn't give you any errors, it indicates that the TypeScript compiler is successfully compiling the code with the settings specified in your `tsconfig.json`. This means that the issue with the `startsWith` method not being recognized as a property of `string` is likely related to your editor's environment rather than the TypeScript configuration itself.

To further troubleshoot the issue within VS Code, try the following steps:

1. **Ensure your workspace is using the correct TypeScript version:**
   Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and type "TypeScript: Select TypeScript version". Check that "Use Workspace Version" is selected.

2. **Restart the TypeScript language service in VS Code:**
   Sometimes the TypeScript language service can get out of sync. You can restart it by opening the command palette and typing "TypeScript: Restart TS server".

3. **Reopen VS Code:**
   Close and reopen VS Code to ensure it's not a temporary glitch.

4. **Check your extensions:**
   If you have any extensions that could potentially interfere with TypeScript, try disabling them to see if that resolves the issue.

5. **Validate your `tsconfig.json` path:**
   Ensure that the `tsconfig.json` file is located at the root of your workspace or in the correct directory that corresponds to where your TypeScript files are located.

6. **Inspect the "Problems" tab in VS Code:**
   The Problems tab (viewable by going to View -> Problems) will list out all the current errors. Check if there are any related issues that might give you a clue as to what's going wrong.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, there might be a problem with your VS Code installation or a conflict with another tool or extension. You might consider reinstalling VS Code or resetting it to default settings as a last resort.

**User** _at 11:58 am, Apr 30, 2024_

`tsconfig.json` is here:

```ps1
🕐[11:53:29]❯ ls *tsconfig.json

  Directory: D:\T3\Projects\self\handex.io

```

---

**Codeium** _at 11:58 am, Apr 30, 2024_

Given that `tsconfig.json` is present in the root of your project, your TypeScript compiler settings should be picked up correctly by VS Code. Since `npx tsc` doesn't yield any errors, the problem is likely within the VS Code environment.

Let's ensure that VS Code is using the TypeScript version and configuration specified in your project:

1. **Open the TypeScript version selector in VS Code:**
   - Use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
   - Type "TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version".
   - Choose "Use Workspace Version".

2. **Restart TS Server in VS Code:**
   - Open the Command Palette again.
   - Type "TypeScript: Restart TS server".

3. **Check for errors in the Problems pane:**
   - Go to the "View" menu, select "Problems", and inspect any issues listed there.

4. **Validate that VS Code is using the correct `tsconfig.json`:**
   - Open any `.ts` file from your project.
   - Click on the TypeScript version number in the bottom-right corner of the VS Code window to open the TypeScript version selector.
   - Make sure that the path to the `tsconfig.json` in the information popup is correct.

5. **Reopen the folder in VS Code:**
   - Sometimes, reopening the folder can refresh the environment.

6. **Check for overrides in settings:**
   - Open settings (File > Preferences > Settings).
   - Search for "typescript" and see if there are any workspace settings that might override the default behavior.

7. **Inspect your extensions:**
   - Disable any TypeScript-related extensions one by one to see if they might be causing the issue.

If you've gone through all of these steps and the issue still persists, it may be helpful to gather more detailed error messages or logs if available. If the issue cannot be resolved through these means, as a last resort, you might consider reinstalling VS Code or resetting it to default settings.

Given that all the previous steps have not resolved the issue, it's possible there might be a problem with the VS Code TypeScript language service cache or with the specific project's setup in the VS Code workspace. Here are a few additional steps you can take:

1. **Clear the VS Code Editor Cache:**
   - Close VS Code.
   - Navigate to the cache directory and delete its content. The cache directory can usually be found at the following paths:
     - On Windows: `%APPDATA%\Code`
     - On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Code`
     - On Linux: `~/.config/Code`
   - Be careful to only delete cache-related files or directories. If unsure, create a backup before deleting anything.

2. **Check the Workspace Settings:**
   - Open the `.vscode` folder in the root of your project (if it exists).
   - Look for a `settings.json` file and check if there are any TypeScript-related settings that might be causing the issue.

3. **Validate the `tsconfig.json`:**
   - Make sure there are no errors in your `tsconfig.json` file.
   - Validate that the `include` and `exclude` properties correctly encompass all necessary files and exclude any that might cause conflicts.

4. **Check for Multiple `tsconfig.json` Files:**
   - Make sure there are no other `tsconfig.json` files in your project that might be conflicting.

5. **Inspect the TypeScript Output:**
   - In VS Code, go to the "View" menu, select "Output", and then select "TypeScript" from the dropdown.
   - Check for any messages that might indicate what's going wrong.

6. **Check for `typescript.tsdk` Setting:**
   - Go to the settings (File > Preferences > Settings).
   - Search for `typescript.tsdk`.
   - If it's set to a custom path, make sure the path is correct, or clear it to use the default TypeScript version provided by VS Code.

7. **Reinstall TypeScript for the Workspace:**
   - Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.
   - Run `npm install` to reinstall the packages.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be helpful to create a new VS Code workspace and import your project files to see if the problem persists in a fresh environment. If the problem goes away in the new workspace, there might have been a configuration issue with the original workspace.

Alternatively, reach out to the VS Code support community or file an issue on the VS Code GitHub repository with details of the problem, as it may be a bug or a specific edge case with the IDE.

The `TypeScript` in the bottom-right status bar lists this file: `assets\jsconfig.json` as the config file.

---

**Codeium** _at 12:03 pm, Apr 30, 2024_

The presence of a `jsconfig.json` file in your `assets` directory indicates that VS Code may be using that configuration for your JavaScript files, which might not include TypeScript configuration settings. A `jsconfig.json` is often used in projects that don't use TypeScript to provide IntelliSense for JavaScript files.

Here's what you can do:

1. **Examine the `jsconfig.json` file content.**
   If it exists, check to see what is specified under the `compilerOptions` section. It's possible that this file has settings conflicting with your `tsconfig.json`, or it may not include the necessary `lib` options for ES2015 (or later) features like `startsWith` and `includes`.

2. **Rename or remove `jsconfig.json`.**
   If you rename or remove `jsconfig.json`, make sure to close and reopen VS Code to ensure it picks up the changes. This will force VS Code to use `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript files instead. Be cautious if you decide to remove it, as it may be there for a reason, especially if you also have JavaScript files in your project.

3. **Adjust the `jsconfig.json` to include `lib` options.**
   If you need to keep the `jsconfig.json` file for JavaScript IntelliSense, you can adjust it to include the required `lib` options for ES2015 or later, similar to your `tsconfig.json`. Here's an example:
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "target": "es6",
       "lib": ["dom", "es2015", "esnext"],
       // ... any other options you have
     },
     "include": [
       // ... files or directories to include
     ]
   }
   ```
4. **Ensure `tsconfig.json` is used for TypeScript files.**
   VS Code should automatically use `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript files and `jsconfig.json` for JavaScript files. However, if they're in the same directory, there could be conflicts. Make sure that your `tsconfig.json` is properly configured and recognized by VS Code for TypeScript files.

After making changes to the configuration files, don't forget to restart the TypeScript server in VS Code:

- Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
- Type "TypeScript: Restart TS server" and select it.

Lastly, ensure that the TypeScript files are within the scope of the `tsconfig.json` by checking the `include` and `exclude` settings. If your TypeScript files are within the `assets` directory, they should be included in the `tsconfig.json` scope for it to take effect.

**User** _at 12:06 pm, Apr 30, 2024_

I removed the `jsconfig.json` and restarted and that seemed to have fixed the problem.

---

**Codeium** _at 12:06 pm, Apr 30, 2024_

Great! I'm glad to hear that removing the `jsconfig.json` file and restarting VS Code resolved the issue. It seems that the `jsconfig.json` file was indeed interfering with the TypeScript configuration and causing VS Code to not recognize the correct settings for your TypeScript files.

With the `jsconfig.json` file removed, VS Code now correctly uses the `tsconfig.json` for your TypeScript environment, which includes the necessary library definitions for ES2015 (or later) features like `startsWith` and `includes`.

If you need to use `jsconfig.json` in the future for JavaScript IntelliSense or other purposes, you can reintroduce it with the correct settings to avoid conflicts with your TypeScript setup.

Remember to periodically review your project's configuration files to ensure they are correctly set up and aligned with the needs of your project. If you encounter any more issues or have further questions, feel free to ask. Happy coding!

**User** _at 3:27 pm, Apr 30, 2024_

Something keeps creating the `jsconfig.json`. What might be doing that and how can I prevent it?

---

**Codeium** _at 3:28 pm, Apr 30, 2024_

If `jsconfig.json` is being recreated automatically, it could be due to an extension or a build process within your project. Here are some steps to identify and prevent this from happening:

1. **Extensions:**
   Check if you have any extensions in VS Code that could be generating this file. Some extensions automatically create a `jsconfig.json` for better IntelliSense or for their own configuration purposes. You can try disabling extensions temporarily to see if the file stops being recreated.

2. **Build Tools or Scripts:**
   Review your build tools and scripts. If you are using a task runner or a build tool like webpack, gulp, or others, check their configuration files for any steps that might generate a `jsconfig.json`.

3. **IDE/Editor Settings:**
   Some IDEs or editors have settings or features that auto-generate configuration files. Look through VS Code settings to see if there's anything related to auto-generating `jsconfig.json`.

4. **Project Initialization Tools:**
   Tools like `create-react-app` or other scaffolding tools may generate a `jsconfig.json` as part of their setup process. If you're using such a tool, consult its documentation for how to customize or prevent this behavior.

5. **File Watchers:**
   If you have file watchers set up (either through extensions or external programs), they might be recreating `jsconfig.json` when they detect changes.

6. **Source Control:**
   If you're using a version control system like Git, make sure that `jsconfig.json` isn't being restored from your repository during operations like `checkout` or `pull`.

7. **Prevent File Creation:**
   As a last resort, you can create a dummy `jsconfig.json` and make it read-only to prevent modifications. However, this is not recommended as it may cause other issues with your tooling or editor.

Once you identify the source that's regenerating `jsconfig.json`, you can adjust its configuration or remove the responsible extension or tool to prevent it from happening again. If you are working in a team, check with your team members to ensure that no one else's environment or tools are causing this file to be recreated.

**User** _at 4:07 pm, Apr 30, 2024_

how do I make the `jsconfig.json` read-only by using PowerShell?

---

**Codeium** _at 4:07 pm, Apr 30, 2024_

In PowerShell, you can make a file read-only by modifying its file attributes. Here's how you can set the `jsconfig.json` file to be read-only:

1. Open PowerShell.

2. Navigate to the directory where your `jsconfig.json` file is located using the `cd` command. For example:
   ```powershell
   cd D:\T3\Projects\self\handex.io\assets
   ```

3. Use the `Set-ItemProperty` cmdlet to change the attributes of `jsconfig.json` to read-only. Here's the command:
   ```powershell
   Set-ItemProperty -Path .\jsconfig.json -Name IsReadOnly -Value $true
   ```

This command will set the read-only attribute on `jsconfig.json`, preventing modifications to the file. If you ever need to remove the read-only attribute, you can use the following command:
```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path .\jsconfig.json -Name IsReadOnly -Value $false
```

Please note that making `jsconfig.json` read-only is a temporary fix and may not be the best solution. It's important to identify the root cause of why the file is being regenerated and address that issue directly.

**Codeium** _at 4:10 pm, Apr 30, 2024_

The error message you're seeing indicates that the `include` array in your `jsconfig.json` is empty. The `include` property is used to specify which files should be included in the project context. If it's empty, TypeScript (or the JavaScript language service in VS Code) doesn't know which files to include for type checking and IntelliSense.

You can fix this by specifying the files or directories you want to include. For example, to include all `.js` files in the `assets` directory and its subdirectories, you can modify the `include` property like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "lib": [
      "dom",
      "es2015",
      "esnext"
    ],
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "*": ["*"]
    }
  },
  "include": [
    "**/*.js"
  ]
}
```

If you also have `.jsx` files, or you want to include TypeScript `.ts` or `.tsx` files, you can add them to the `include` array as well:

```json
  "include": [
    "**/*.js",
    "**/*.jsx",
    "**/*.ts",
    "**/*.tsx"
  ]
```

Make sure to replace the file patterns with the ones that match your project's structure. After you've updated your `jsconfig.json`, restart the TypeScript service in VS Code:

- Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
- Type "TypeScript: Restart TS server" and select it.

This should resolve the error message you're receiving. If you have a mix of JavaScript and TypeScript files, you may need to adjust your `tsconfig.json` and `jsconfig.json` to work harmoniously together.

It appears that the extraneous `jsconfig.json` is created by Hugo, and it does it on every rebuild.

I've reviewd the Hugo docs and `noJSConfigInAssets` is supposed to prevent it. 

I have this in `config/_default/build.toml`:

```toml
[build]
  noJSConfigInAssets = true
  buildStats = true
```

But it still keeps recreating and overwriting the `jsconfig.json`

---

**Codeium** _at 8:14 am, May 1, 2024_

If Hugo keeps recreating the `jsconfig.json` file despite having `noJSConfigInAssets = true` in your `build.toml`, it's possible there might be an issue with the Hugo version you are using, or there might be another part of your Hugo configuration that is causing the setting to be ignored.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Verify Hugo Version:**
   Ensure that you're using a version of Hugo that supports the `noJSConfigInAssets` option. It's possible this is a newer feature that might not be available in older versions of Hugo.

2. **Check Configuration File:**
   Make sure that `config/_default/build.toml` is the correct path for your build configuration and that Hugo is properly reading from this file. In some cases, configurations might be overridden by other files or command-line arguments.

3. **Check for Overrides:**
   Look for any other configuration files or command-line arguments that might be overriding the `noJSConfigInAssets` setting.

4. **Hugo Documentation:**
   Double-check the Hugo documentation for the correct usage of `noJSConfigInAssets`. There might be additional context or related settings that need to be configured.

5. **Clear Hugo Cache:**
   Try clearing Hugo's cache to see if that resolves the issue. Hugo may have cached an older version of the configuration.

6. **Hugo Community and Issues:**
   If the above steps don't resolve the issue, consider reaching out to the Hugo community or searching for related issues on the Hugo GitHub repository. It's possible that others have encountered this problem and there might be a known solution or workaround.

7. **Workaround:**
   As a temporary workaround, you might consider adding a post-build script to delete the `jsconfig.json` file after Hugo finishes building your site.

Here's an example of a simple post-build script you can run after your Hugo build process completes:
```powershell
Remove-Item -Path "path\to\your\assets\jsconfig.json" -Force
```

Replace `path\to\your\assets\jsconfig.json` with the actual path to the `jsconfig.json` file that Hugo generates.

Finally, if you believe this to be a bug with Hugo, consider filing an issue on the [Hugo GitHub repository](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues) with details of your setup and the steps you've taken to diagnose the problem.

`hugo serve` runs in watch mode, so I am not sure where I would put that `Remove-Item` that would run every time Hugo rebuilds, which is every time a file changes.

Given that `hugo serve` runs in watch mode and rebuilds the site whenever a file changes, you would need a way to continuously monitor for changes to the `jsconfig.json` file and remove it each time it gets recreated.

You can achieve this by running a separate PowerShell script in the background that watches the `jsconfig.json` file and deletes it whenever it is created. Here's a simple PowerShell script that you can run in the background:

```powershell
$watcher = New-Object System.IO.FileSystemWatcher
$watcher.Path = "path\to\your\assets"
$watcher.Filter = "jsconfig.json"
$watcher.IncludeSubdirectories = $false
$watcher.EnableRaisingEvents = $true

$action = { Remove-Item -Path "path\to\your\assets\jsconfig.json" -Force }

Register-ObjectEvent -InputObject $watcher -EventName Created -Action $action

# To stop the watcher, you can run: Unregister-Event -SubscriptionId <ID>
```

Replace `path\to\your\assets` with the actual path to the directory where the `jsconfig.json` file is being created.

Run this script in a separate PowerShell instance before you start `hugo serve`. It will keep running in the background, monitoring the specified directory for the creation of `jsconfig.json` and deleting it whenever it appears.

To stop the watcher, you can either close the PowerShell instance running the script or use the `Unregister-Event` cmdlet with the subscription ID that's provided when you start the watcher.

Keep in mind that this is a workaround, and it would be better to resolve the issue at its source. If the `noJSConfigInAssets` setting is not working as expected, it may be worth reporting this as an issue to the Hugo maintainers.
