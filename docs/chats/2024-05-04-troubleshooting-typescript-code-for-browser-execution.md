summary: The user is experiencing issues with their TypeScript code when trying to run it in the browser. Initially, the code was producing a CommonJS module syntax error in the browser DevTools. I suggested changing the TypeScript compiler output to ES Modules in the `tsconfig.json` file. After making the change and recompiling, the user encountered a new error stating "Cannot use import statement outside a module." I then advised them to add the `type="module"` attribute to the script tag in their HTML file to indicate that the JavaScript file should be treated as an ES module.

My `chord-phrase.ts` is very small now that I have refactored out several classes into the `HandChord` and it's dependencies. 

This is my `chord-phrase.ts`:

```ts
import { HandChord } from "./HandChord";

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const handChord = new HandChord();
  handChord.updateTimerDisplay(handChord);
});
```

When the site is built it produces this `chord-phrase.js`

```js
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
const HandChord_1 = require("./HandChord");
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const handChord = new HandChord_1.HandChord();
  handChord.updateTimerDisplay(handChord);
});
//# sourceMappingURL=chord-phrase.js.map
```

Which shows an error in the DevTools:

```

chord-phrase.js:2  
Uncaught ReferenceError: exports is not defined
    at chord-phrase.js:2:23
(anonymous)@chord-phrase.js:2
```

The error you're seeing in the DevTools is likely because the compiled JavaScript is using CommonJS module syntax (`exports` and `require`), which is not natively supported in the browser. Browsers natively support ES Modules, which use `import` and `export` statements.

To fix this issue, you need to configure your TypeScript compiler to output ES Modules instead of CommonJS modules. This can be done by setting the `module` option in your `tsconfig.json` file to `"es2020"`, `"es6"`, or any other ES module format that is appropriate for the browsers you are targeting.

Here's what you might add or change in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "es2020",
    "target": "es6",
    // ... other options
  }
  // ... potentially other config settings
}
```

After making this change, recompile your TypeScript files. The output should now use ES Modules, which should eliminate the error you're seeing in the browser.

I switched it to 

```json
"module": "es2020",
"target": "es6"
```

and now I get:

```js
import { HandChord } from "./HandChord";
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const handChord = new HandChord();
  handChord.updateTimerDisplay(handChord);
});
```

Which throws this:

```
Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module (at chord-phrase.js:1:1)
```

The error message indicates that the browser is not recognizing the `import` statement because the script is not being executed as a module. To resolve this, you need to specify that the script is a module by using the `type="module"` attribute in the `<script>` tag that loads your JavaScript file.

Update the script tag in your HTML to include the `type="module"` attribute like this:

```html
<script type="module" src="path/to/your/chord-phrase.js"></script>
```

This tells the browser to treat the script as an ES module, which allows the use of `import` and `export` statements. Make sure to replace `path/to/your/chord-phrase.js` with the actual path to your JavaScript file.
