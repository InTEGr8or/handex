Explain problem: `JSX element implicitly has type 'any' because no interface 'JSX.IntrinsicElements' exists.`

The issue "JSX element implicitly has type 'any' because no interface 'JSX.IntrinsicElements' exists" occurs because the JSX element `<use>` is not a standard HTML element and therefore TypeScript doesn't have a predefined type for it in the `JSX.IntrinsicElements` interface.

To resolve this, you can create an interface for the custom SVG elements you are using in your project. Here's an example of how you can define an interface for the `use` element:

```tsx
declare global {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
      'use': React.SVGProps<SVGUseElement>;
    }
  }
}
```

You can add this declaration at the beginning of your file or in a separate file to provide TypeScript with the necessary type information for the custom SVG elements like `<use>` that you are using in your JSX code.

This declaration tells TypeScript that the `<use>` element in your JSX code should be treated as an SVG element with properties that match `SVGUseElement` from the React typings.

What file would I put that in?

You can put the interface declaration in a TypeScript declaration file (`.d.ts`) that is included in your project. For example, you can create a file named `svg.d.ts` in your project with the following content:

```typescript
// svg.d.ts
declare global {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
      'use': React.SVGProps<SVGUseElement>;
    }
  }
}

export {};
```

Make sure that this declaration file is included in your TypeScript compilation context by either being in a directory covered by your `tsconfig.json` file or by explicitly including it in the `files` or `include` arrays of that config file.

Afterwards, TypeScript will use this declaration along with its built-in JSX type definitions to type check your JSX code. If you add this to a `.d.ts` file that's already part of your project's type declaration structure, it should be picked up automatically by the TypeScript compiler.
