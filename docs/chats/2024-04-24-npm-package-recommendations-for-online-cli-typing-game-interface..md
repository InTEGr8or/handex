summary: The user sought advice on NPM packages for creating an online CLI interface in the browser for a typing practice game. They had already implemented interactions and a WPM calculator and were now looking for assistance with CLI layout, prompts structure, and UI events. I provided a list of NPM packages that could help, including xterm.js, blessed-contrib, readline-browserify, jquery.terminal, hterm, and ace.

Later, the user expressed interest in integrating Vim navigation into their CLI interface. I suggested options like CodeMirror with Vim mode, Monaco Editor with Vim mode, Ace Editor with Vim mode, Firenvim, WASM-Neovim, and vim.wasm as potential solutions for incorporating Vim-like editing capabilities into their web-based application.

I would like your broad knowledge of NPM packages that pertain to creating online CLI interfaces in the browser.

My CLI will just be for a typing-practice game, like "Typing of the Dead" and others. I want to present the user with timed typing challenges and monitor their WPM.

I have implemented some of the interactions already, and the WPM calculator.Â 


Now I want to just consider any NPM packages that might assist with the CLI layout, prompts structure and UI events. Do you know of any?

From the context I have, I see that `xterm.js`, `blessed-contrib`, `readline-browserify`, `jquery.terminal`, `hterm`, and `ace` were suggested in `{docs\chats\Codeium Chat - U0W4I9lRlX1xJaJ8gDOMDM0zzk81OacJ.md}` as NPM packages that could assist with creating a CLI interface in the browser.

Here are some details:

1. **xterm.js**: A terminal front-end component that can be embedded in web applications, used in online IDEs and cloud-based code editors.

   ```sh
   npm install xterm
   ```

2. **blessed-contrib**: A browser-compatible version of `blessed` for creating text-based UIs.

   ```sh
   npm install blessed-contrib
   ```

3. **readline-browserify**: A browser version of Node's readline for handling command-line input and history.

   ```sh
   npm install readline-browserify
   ```

4. **jquery.terminal**: A jQuery plugin for terminal-like interfaces with features like command-line history and tab completion.

   ```sh
   npm install jquery.terminal
   ```

5. **hterm**: A robust terminal emulator used by Chromium, which could be more complex than needed.

   ```sh
   npm install hterm
   ```

6. **ace**: A standalone code editor which can be adapted for sophisticated text input areas with features such as syntax highlighting.

   ```sh
   npm install ace-builds
   ```

These packages offer various features that could be useful for your typing-practice game's CLI interface.

That is the right context, but now I would like to consider one additional feature.

Soon, I will be trying to integrate some level of VIM navigation. I don't neccessarily have to implement that in the `textarea.prompt`, since the editable text might be edited in the `terminal-output`, but I think I should consider that it might be more of a common convention to edit code in the prompt input area. 

I'm sure that none of the above CLI libraries have built in VIM support, but do you know of any that have been used in open-source integrations with Vim or NeoVim, or if there is any open-source web-based Vim/NeoVim libraries, even if they just provide a limited set of Vim/NeoVim editing capabilities.

For integrating Vim-like navigation and editing capabilities in a web-based environment, you might want to consider the following options:

1. **CodeMirror with Vim mode**: CodeMirror is a versatile text editor implemented in JavaScript for the browser. It has a Vim keymap which emulates Vim features to a large extent.

   ```sh
   npm install codemirror
   ```
   
   After installing CodeMirror, you can enable Vim mode by including the Vim keymap script and setting the keymap option to "vim".

2. **Monaco Editor with Vim mode**: Monaco Editor is the code editor that powers VS Code, and it can also be run in a browser. There is a plugin available that adds Vim keybindings to Monaco.

   ```sh
   npm install monaco-editor
   npm install monaco-vim
   ```

3. **Ace Editor with Vim mode**: Ace, mentioned previously, also has a Vim mode available. It is a powerful, high-performance code editor that can be easily embedded.

   ```sh
   npm install ace-builds
   ```
   
   Ace can be configured to use Vim keybindings by setting the keyboard handler to "ace/keyboard/vim".

4. **Firenvim**: While not an NPM package, Firenvim is a browser extension that lets you use Neovim directly in your browser for text input fields. It might provide inspiration on how to integrate a full-fledged Neovim instance in your application.

5. **WASM-Neovim**: This project compiles Neovim to WebAssembly, allowing you to run an actual Neovim editor instance in the browser. This could be a more advanced and involved option if you need comprehensive Vim functionality.

6. **vim.wasm**: This is Vim compiled to WebAssembly, which provides Vim experience in the browser. It might be used as a standalone editor or integrated into your application for specific functionalities.

By using these libraries and plugins, you can bring Vim or Neovim editing capabilities into your browser-based CLI interface. The integration level may vary depending on how much of the Vim experience you wish to replicate, but these solutions provide a good starting point for common Vim features.
