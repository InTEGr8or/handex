I would like to explore a kind of proof-of-concept attempt at integrating a NPM package into my Hugo static site, and I need your help making sure that I can reliably deploy it to GitHub Pages while using my GitHub Action `gh-pages.yml`

The first one I want to try is: `npm iÂ @clack/prompts`.

It's very lightweight and I think Hugo is supposed to be able to fairly easily integrate NPM packages, but I want to find out.

How should I start this experiment?

To integrate an NPM package like `@clack/prompts` into your Hugo static site and ensure it's deployed using your GitHub Actions workflow (`handex.io/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`), you'll need to update your build process to include the installation of NPM dependencies and potentially modify your Hugo setup if you need to use JavaScript modules. Here's a step-by-step guide to start your experiment:

1. **Initialize NPM in Your Hugo Project:**
   If you haven't already, initialize NPM in your Hugo project directory.

   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install the NPM Package:**
   Install the `@clack/prompts` package with NPM.

   ```sh
   npm i @clack/prompts
   ```

3. **Import the Package in Your JavaScript:**
   Create or modify a JavaScript file in your Hugo asset pipeline to import and use the `@clack/prompts` package. For example, create `assets/js/prompts.js`.

   ```javascript
   import prompts from '@clack/prompts';

   // Use prompts as needed in your JavaScript
   ```

4. **Update Your Hugo Configuration:**
   Make sure your Hugo configuration is set up to process your JavaScript assets. This might involve configuring a build tool like PostCSS or setting up Hugo Pipes if you need to transpile modern JavaScript.

5. **Modify Your GitHub Action Workflow:**
   Update your `gh-pages.yml` workflow to install Node.js and your NPM dependencies before building the site.

   Here's an example of how you can modify the existing workflow:

   ```yaml
   name: GitHub Pages

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - master  # Set a branch to deploy
     pull_request:

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
       concurrency:
         group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
           with:
             submodules: true  # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive)
             fetch-depth: 0    # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod

         - name: Set up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v3
           with:
             node-version: '14' # Use the Node.js version that matches your development environment

         - name: Install NPM dependencies
           run: npm install

         - name: Setup Hugo
           uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
           with:
             hugo-version: 'latest'
             extended: true

         - name: Build
           run: hugo --minify

         - name: Deploy
           uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
           if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/master' }}
           with:
             github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             publish_dir: ./public
             destination_dir: ./
             publish_branch: published
             cname: handex.io
   ```

   Note the addition of steps to set up Node.js and install NPM dependencies before the Hugo build step.

6. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**
   Commit the changes to your `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, the new JavaScript file, and the updated GitHub Actions workflow to your repository.

7. **Monitor GitHub Actions:**
   After pushing your changes, monitor the GitHub Actions tab in your repository to ensure the workflow runs successfully and deploys your changes to GitHub Pages.

This should set up the basic integration of the NPM package with your Hugo site and the deployment via GitHub Actions. Remember that depending on how `@clack/prompts` works, you might need to make additional adjustments to integrate the prompts into your static site's interactivity.
