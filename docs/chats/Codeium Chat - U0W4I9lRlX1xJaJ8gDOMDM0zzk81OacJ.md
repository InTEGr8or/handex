**User** _at 10:28 am, Apr 21, 2024_

I would like to explore a kind of proof-of-concept attempt at integrating a NPM package into my Hugo static site, and I need your help making sure that I can reliably deploy it to GitHub Pages while using my GitHub Action `gh-pages.yml`

The first one I want to try is: `npm iÂ @clack/prompts`.

It's very lightweight and I think Hugo is supposed to be able to fairly easily integrate NPM packages, but I want to find out.

How should I start this experiment?

**Codeium** _at 10:29 am, Apr 21, 2024_

To integrate an NPM package like `@clack/prompts` into your Hugo static site and ensure it's deployed using your GitHub Actions workflow (`handex.io/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`), you'll need to update your build process to include the installation of NPM dependencies and potentially modify your Hugo setup if you need to use JavaScript modules. Here's a step-by-step guide to start your experiment:

1. **Initialize NPM in Your Hugo Project:**
   If you haven't already, initialize NPM in your Hugo project directory.

   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install the NPM Package:**
   Install the `@clack/prompts` package with NPM.

   ```sh
   npm i @clack/prompts
   ```

3. **Import the Package in Your JavaScript:**
   Create or modify a JavaScript file in your Hugo asset pipeline to import and use the `@clack/prompts` package. For example, create `assets/js/prompts.js`.

   ```javascript
   import prompts from '@clack/prompts';

   // Use prompts as needed in your JavaScript
   ```

4. **Update Your Hugo Configuration:**
   Make sure your Hugo configuration is set up to process your JavaScript assets. This might involve configuring a build tool like PostCSS or setting up Hugo Pipes if you need to transpile modern JavaScript.

5. **Modify Your GitHub Action Workflow:**
   Update your `gh-pages.yml` workflow to install Node.js and your NPM dependencies before building the site.

   Here's an example of how you can modify the existing workflow:

   ```yaml
   name: GitHub Pages

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - master  # Set a branch to deploy
     pull_request:

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
       concurrency:
         group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
           with:
             submodules: true  # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive)
             fetch-depth: 0    # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod

         - name: Set up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v3
           with:
             node-version: '14' # Use the Node.js version that matches your development environment

         - name: Install NPM dependencies
           run: npm install

         - name: Setup Hugo
           uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
           with:
             hugo-version: 'latest'
             extended: true

         - name: Build
           run: hugo --minify

         - name: Deploy
           uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
           if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/master' }}
           with:
             github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             publish_dir: ./public
             destination_dir: ./
             publish_branch: published
             cname: handex.io
   ```

   Note the addition of steps to set up Node.js and install NPM dependencies before the Hugo build step.

6. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**
   Commit the changes to your `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, the new JavaScript file, and the updated GitHub Actions workflow to your repository.

7. **Monitor GitHub Actions:**
   After pushing your changes, monitor the GitHub Actions tab in your repository to ensure the workflow runs successfully and deploys your changes to GitHub Pages.

This should set up the basic integration of the NPM package with your Hugo site and the deployment via GitHub Actions. Remember that depending on how `@clack/prompts` works, you might need to make additional adjustments to integrate the prompts into your static site's interactivity.

**User** _at 10:18 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

I am having a little trouble debugging my TypeScript in VS Code while running this Hugo static site locally.

Are there any TypeScript packages or VS Code setup that will make TypeScript debugging in VS Code much better?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:19 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

To improve TypeScript debugging in VS Code while working with a Hugo static site, you should ensure that you have the proper setup and tooling. Here's what you can do to enhance your TypeScript debugging experience:

1. **Install TypeScript:**
   If you haven't already, make sure TypeScript is installed globally or in your project.

   ```sh
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

   Or for a local installation:

   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev typescript
   ```

2. **Install VS Code Extensions:**
   The following extensions can greatly improve your TypeScript development in VS Code:

   - **TypeScript Language Basics** (built-in): This is included with VS Code and provides syntax highlighting and basic IntelliSense for TypeScript.
   - **TypeScript TSLint Plugin** or **ESLint**: These provide linting for TypeScript. ESLint is more commonly used nowadays with proper TypeScript support.
   - **Code Runner**: Allows you to run code snippets or files for multiple languages, including TypeScript.

   You can install these from the VS Code Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).

3. **Configure `tsconfig.json`:**
   Ensure you have a properly configured `tsconfig.json` in your project root. This file controls the TypeScript compiler options.

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "target": "es5",
       "module": "commonjs",
       "sourceMap": true, // Enable source maps for debugging
       // ... other options as needed
     },
     "include": [
       "path/to/your/typescript/files/**/*.ts"
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Configure VS Code for Debugging:**
   Set up a launch configuration for VS Code to debug TypeScript. Go to the Debug view (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or `Cmd+Shift+D` on macOS), click on the gear icon to create a `launch.json` file, and add a configuration for Node.js:

   ```json
   {
     "version": "0.2.0",
     "configurations": [
       {
         "type": "node",
         "request": "launch",
         "name": "Launch Program",
         "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
         "program": "${workspaceFolder}/path/to/your/entry.ts",
         "preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - tsconfig.json", // This will compile TypeScript before debugging
         "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/path/to/your/compiled/javascript/**/*.js"],
         "sourceMaps": true
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Create NPM Scripts:**
   Add scripts to your `package.json` for building and starting your Hugo site with TypeScript files.

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "build": "tsc && hugo",
       "start": "hugo server"
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Run and Debug:**
   With the setup complete, you can start debugging by going to the Debug view and starting the launch configuration you set up. Breakpoints can be set directly in your TypeScript files.

Remember to build your TypeScript files (`tsc` command or the build script in your `package.json`) before running the Hugo server locally, so the most recent JavaScript is served. If you encounter any issues, verify that source maps are being generated correctly (`"sourceMap": true` in `tsconfig.json`) and that the paths in your `launch.json` are correct.

**User** _at 10:26 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

I don't have a `tsconfig.json`. Should I just cre`ate one by hand or should I run some kind of `typescript init` or something?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:27 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

You should create a `tsconfig.json` file to configure TypeScript options for your project. You can generate a basic `tsconfig.json` file by running the TypeScript initializer command in your terminal:

```sh
npx tsc --init
```

This command will create a `tsconfig.json` file with default options that you can then customize for your project. The generated file will include comments explaining what each option does, which can be very helpful.

Here's a simple example of what your `tsconfig.json` might look like after running the initializer, tailored for a project with a Hugo static site:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",                           // Set the JavaScript version for output files
    "module": "commonjs",                      // Specify the module code generation method
    "lib": ["dom", "esnext"],                  // Specify a list of library files to be included in the compilation
    "outDir": "./static/js",                   // Redirect output structure to the directory
    "rootDir": "./assets/ts",                  // Specify the root directory of input files
    "strict": true,                            // Enable all strict type checking options
    "esModuleInterop": true,                   // Enable compatibility with Babel module imports
    "sourceMap": true                          // Enable source map generation for debugging
  },
  "include": [
    "assets/ts/**/*.ts"                        // Include all TypeScript files in the assets/ts folder
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"                             // Exclude the node_modules folder
  ]
}
```

Make sure to adjust the `outDir` and `rootDir` options to match the directory structure of your Hugo site. The `outDir` is typically set to the directory where Hugo expects to find your JavaScript files, and the `rootDir` is where your TypeScript source files are located.

After creating and configuring your `tsconfig.json`, you can compile your TypeScript files by running `tsc` (or `npx tsc` if TypeScript is installed locally), or by using a build script in your `package.json`.

**User** _at 10:42 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

Your "Launch Program" VS Code launch config above does not have a `hugo serve` command. Was that intentional

---

**Codeium** _at 10:43 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

Yes, it was intentional because the "Launch Program" launch configuration in VS Code is meant to debug Node.js applications, not to run or debug external commands like Hugo's server. To debug TypeScript in the context of a Hugo site, you typically compile the TypeScript to JavaScript and then let Hugo serve the static files.

However, running `hugo serve` alongside the debugger can be part of your development workflow, but it would be done outside of the VS Code debugger. Here's how you can handle it:

1. **Run Hugo Server:**
   Open a terminal in VS Code and run the Hugo server with the `hugo serve` command. This will serve your static site locally, watching for changes.

   ```sh
   hugo serve
   ```

2. **Debug TypeScript:**
   Use the VS Code debugger to debug your TypeScript code. The debugger will attach to the Node.js process if you are debugging server-side TypeScript or a build process.

If you want to debug client-side TypeScript (which runs in the browser), you would need to use the browser's developer tools. Here's how you can set up VS Code for browser-side debugging:

1. **Install the Debugger for Chrome or Debugger for Edge Extension:**
   Install one of these extensions in VS Code, depending on which browser you prefer for debugging.

2. **Create a Launch Configuration for Browser Debugging:**
   In your `.vscode/launch.json`, add a configuration for the Chrome or Edge debugger:

   ```json
   {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
           {
               "type": "chrome", // or "edge" for Microsoft Edge
               "request": "launch",
               "name": "Launch Chrome against localhost",
               "url": "http://localhost:1313", // Replace with your Hugo server URL and port
               "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
               "sourceMaps": true,
               "preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - tsconfig.json" // Compile TypeScript before launching the browser
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

3. **Start Debugging:**
   Use this launch configuration to start a debugging session. VS Code will open a new browser instance with debugging enabled and attach to it. You can set breakpoints in your TypeScript files, and they should be hit when the corresponding code is executed in the browser.

Remember that this setup assumes you are debugging client-side TypeScript. If you are debugging TypeScript that is part of a build process (for example, a Node.js script that processes files during the Hugo build), then you would use the original "Launch Program" configuration instead.

---

**User** _at 10:57 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

You mentioned that I should start Hugo with something like `tsc && hugo serve`. Does Hugo have a way of sort of automating that or should I write a `Start-Hugo.ps1` or something to wrap the setup to start this site?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:57 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

Hugo itself doesn't have built-in support for compiling TypeScript as part of its serve or build commands. However, you can automate the process of compiling TypeScript and then starting the Hugo server by using NPM scripts in your `package.json` file or by writing a custom shell script. Here's how you can do it with each method:

### Using NPM Scripts

You can define a custom script in your `package.json` that first compiles TypeScript and then starts the Hugo server:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "tsc && hugo serve"
  }
}
```

With this script in place, you can start your development environment by running:

```sh
npm start
```

This command will compile your TypeScript files and then start the Hugo development server.

### Creating a Shell Script

Alternatively, you can create a custom shell script, like `start-hugo.sh` for Unix-based systems or `Start-Hugo.ps1` for Windows PowerShell, to run the commands in sequence.

For Unix-based systems (start-hugo.sh):

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# Compile TypeScript files
tsc

# Start Hugo server
hugo serve
```

Make the script executable:

```sh
chmod +x start-hugo.sh
```

Then run the script:

```sh
./start-hugo.sh
```

For Windows PowerShell (Start-Hugo.ps1):

```powershell
# Compile TypeScript files
tsc

# Start Hugo server
hugo serve
```

And to run the PowerShell script:

```powershell
.\Start-Hugo.ps1
```

### Continuous TypeScript Compilation

If you want TypeScript to recompile files automatically as they change, you can use the TypeScript compiler's watch mode:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "tsc-watch": "tsc --watch",
    "start": "npm run tsc-watch & hugo serve"
  }
}
```

This configuration uses `tsc --watch` to start TypeScript in watch mode, where it will recompile files as they are saved. The `&` in the `start` script is used to run `hugo serve` in parallel with TypeScript's watch mode.

Just keep in mind that the parallel execution syntax (`&`) might differ between Unix and Windows shells, so you may need to adjust the script accordingly or use cross-platform tools like `npm-run-all` for a more uniform experience.

### Conclusion

Both of these methods are valid ways to automate the process of compiling TypeScript and starting the Hugo server. Choose the one that best fits your workflow and environment preferences.

**User** _at 11:01 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

I like that last one.

Should I `npm -i ts-node`, or is that only for server-side TypeScript Node?

---

**Codeium** _at 11:01 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

`ts-node` is a TypeScript execution engine and REPL for Node.js. It allows you to execute TypeScript directly, without having to compile it to JavaScript beforehand. This can be very useful for server-side development with Node.js when you want to run TypeScript scripts directly.

For a static site generated by Hugo, where TypeScript is primarily used to write client-side scripts that run in the browser, `ts-node` is not necessary. The browser does not understand TypeScript natively, so you need to compile TypeScript to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). The compiled JavaScript files are then served by Hugo to the browser.

However, if you have server-side scripts or build tools written in TypeScript as part of your development process (which are executed under Node.js and not intended to run in the browser), then `ts-node` can be a convenient tool. It would allow you to execute these scripts without the separate compilation step.

Based on your needs:

- If you want to run TypeScript code on the server-side with Node.js without a separate compilation step, then you can install `ts-node`:

  ```sh
  npm install --save-dev ts-node
  ```

- If you're only using TypeScript for client-side code in your Hugo site, then there's no need for `ts-node`; continue using `tsc` for compilation as you've set up with the `tsc --watch` script.

In conclusion, whether you should install `ts-node` depends on how you're using TypeScript in your project. For typical Hugo sites with client-side TypeScript, `ts-node` is not required.

**User** _at 11:06 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

I like this `"npm run tsc-watch & hugo serve"`. It's giving me errors for things that we should fix.

```
assets/ts/terminal.ts:138:13 - error TS2564: Property 'inputElement' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.

138Â Â Â private inputElement: ITerminalInputElement;
```

---

**Codeium** _at 11:07 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

The error you're encountering indicates that the `inputElement` property in the `TerminalGame` class is declared but not initialized in the constructor, and TypeScript's `strictPropertyInitialization` check is enforcing that class properties be initialized.

To address this, you have a few options:

1. **Initialize the Property in the Constructor:**
   Assign a value to `inputElement` within the constructor of your `TerminalGame` class.

2. **Assign a Default Value at Declaration:**
   Provide a default value when you declare the property if there's an appropriate default.

3. **Use the Non-Null Assertion Operator:**
   If you're certain that `inputElement` will be initialized before any access, you can use a non-null assertion operator (`!`) to tell TypeScript that the value will be non-null.

Here's how you can apply each of these options:

### Option 1: Initialize in Constructor

```typescript
class TerminalGame {
  private inputElement: ITerminalInputElement;

  constructor(private terminal: HTMLElement) {
    // Other initialization...
    this.inputElement = this.createInputElement();
  }

  private createInputElement(): ITerminalInputElement {
    // Logic to create ITerminalInputElement
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Default Value at Declaration

```typescript
class TerminalGame {
  private inputElement: ITerminalInputElement = someDefaultInputElement;
  // ...
}
```

### Option 3: Non-Null Assertion Operator

```typescript
class TerminalGame {
  private inputElement!: ITerminalInputElement;
  // ...
}
```

Choose the option that best fits the logic of your class. In many cases, initializing the property in the constructor is the safest and most explicit method, ensuring that the property is never `undefined` when it's used. The non-null assertion operator should be used with caution, as it bypasses TypeScript's safety checks and can lead to runtime errors if the property is accessed before being properly initialized.

---

**User** _at 11:12 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

What does the Non-Null Assertion Operator do in this case?

---

**Codeium** _at 11:12 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

The Non-Null Assertion Operator (`!`) is a postfix expression that tells TypeScript to assume that a value is not null or undefined. When you use this operator, you're essentially telling the compiler that you're certain the value will be assigned before any attempts to access it, even though you're not initializing it at the point of declaration or within the constructor.

Here's what it does in your case:

```typescript
class TerminalGame {
  private inputElement!: ITerminalInputElement;
  // ...
}
```

By adding `!` after the `inputElement` property declaration, you're asserting to TypeScript that `inputElement` will be assigned to a non-null value and that it's safe to bypass the strict null checks for this property.

This is useful when you know through the logic of your program that the property will be initialized before use, but TypeScript's static analysis is unable to verify this. For example, you may be setting the property in a method that is always called before the property is used, or through dependency injection which TypeScript is not aware of.

However, if you use the Non-Null Assertion Operator and then access the property before it's actually assigned, it will result in a runtime error. Therefore, while this operator can be useful in certain situations where you have control over the initialization flow, it should be used with caution and only when you are absolutely sure that the property will not be `null` or `undefined` when accessed.

Now when I run this `npm run tsc-watch & hugo serve` I can see that it is watching the directory for changes, but I can't see that it started `hugo serve`. I can't see the site in the browser.

---

**Codeium** _at 11:21 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

When you run `npm run tsc-watch & hugo serve`, the `&` operator runs both commands concurrently, but the output from `hugo serve` might be getting mixed up with the output from `tsc --watch`, making it difficult to see the status of the Hugo server.

Here are a few ways you can address this issue:

### Separate Terminals

Run each command in a separate terminal window or tab. This will allow you to see the output from each command clearly without them interfering with each other.

- Terminal 1:

  ```sh
  npm run tsc-watch
  ```

- Terminal 2:

  ```sh
  hugo serve
  ```

### NPM Concurrently Package

Use the `concurrently` NPM package to run multiple commands concurrently with better control over their output. First, install the package:

```sh
npm install --save-dev concurrently
```

Then, modify your `package.json` scripts to use `concurrently`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "tsc-watch": "tsc --watch",
    "hugo-serve": "hugo serve",
    "start": "concurrently \"npm run tsc-watch\" \"npm run hugo-serve\""
  }
}
```

Now, when you run `npm start`, `concurrently` will start both `tsc --watch` and `hugo serve`, each in its own context, and you'll be able to see both outputs more clearly.

### Separate Scripts for Watching and Serving

Another method is to create separate scripts for watching and serving, and then manually start each one in different terminals:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "watch-ts": "tsc --watch",
    "serve": "hugo serve"
  }
}
```

Run each script in a separate terminal:

- Terminal 1:

  ```sh
  npm run watch-ts
  ```

- Terminal 2:

  ```sh
  npm run serve
  ```

### Background Execution

If you're using a Unix-like shell, you can run `tsc --watch` in the background properly so that it doesn't block the hugo serve command:

```sh
npm run tsc-watch &
hugo serve
```

In this case, the `&` puts `npm run tsc-watch` in the background, and `hugo serve` runs in the foreground. You should see the output from `hugo serve` clearly.

Choose the method that works best for your development process. Using `concurrently` is a neat and organized way to handle multiple concurrent tasks with clear output for each, but separate terminals can be just as effective if you prefer a more manual approach.

**User** _at 11:23 pm, Apr 21, 2024_

Yes, when I run `hugo serve` in a separate terminal, it starts it at the  default port, `http://localhost:1313/`, so the `hugo serve` command did not run in the first terminal.

---

It looks like the issue might be related to how the shell is handling the concurrent commands. When you use the `&` operator, the first command (`npm run tsc-watch`) is being sent to the background, and the second command (`hugo serve`) is likely not being executed immediately or its output is not being displayed because the background process is still active.

To ensure that both commands run properly and their output is visible, you can use one of the methods I described previously. Running each command in a separate terminal is the simplest solution and gives you clear visibility into the output of each process.

Here's a quick recap of how to run the commands in separate terminals:

**Terminal 1:**
```sh
npm run tsc-watch
```

**Terminal 2:**
```sh
hugo serve
```

This way, you can see the TypeScript compiler's output in one terminal and the Hugo server's output in another, making it much easier to debug issues with either process.

If you prefer a single command to launch both processes with clear output for each, consider using the `concurrently` package as mentioned earlier. This approach will allow you to run both commands with a single `npm start` command, and `concurrently` will manage the output streams for you.

I haven't tried `concurrently` yet. That looks promising. It is still installing.

Great! Once `concurrently` is installed, it should help you manage running multiple commands at the same time without the complexity of juggling terminal outputs.

Here's a quick guide on how to set it up once the installation is complete:

1. Open your `package.json` file.

2. Under the `scripts` section, add a new script that uses `concurrently` to run both `tsc --watch` and `hugo serve`. It might look something like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently \"npm run tsc-watch\" \"npm run hugo-serve\"",
  "tsc-watch": "tsc --watch",
  "hugo-serve": "hugo serve"
}
```

3. Save your `package.json` file.

4. Now run the combined script with:

```sh
npm start
```

This command will start both the TypeScript compiler in watch mode and the Hugo server in a way that you can see the output from both. `concurrently` will manage the processes, so if one fails, you'll be able to see the error messages clearly.

`concurrently` also provides many options to prefix the output of each command so you can easily distinguish which output is coming from which process. You can further customize your script to use these options if needed.

That works very well. 

Now I would like your broad knowledge of NPM packages that pertain to creating online CLI interfaces in the browser.

My CLI will just be for a typing-practice game, like "Typing of the Dead" and others. I want to present the user with timed typing challenges and monitor their WPM.

I have implemented some of the interactions already, and the WPM calculator. 

Now I want to just consider any NPM packages that might assist with the CLI layout, prompts structure and UI events. Do you know of any?

For building a browser-based CLI interface, you'll want to look for packages that can help with terminal emulation, command-line input, and possibly syntax highlighting if you want to simulate a more code-like environment. Here are a few NPM packages that could assist you with the CLI layout, prompt structure, and UI events:

1. **xterm.js**: This is a terminal front-end component written in TypeScript that can be easily embedded in any web application. It's used in many online IDEs and cloud-based code editors.

   ```sh
   npm install xterm
   ```

2. **blessed**: A curses-like library for Node.js that's geared towards creating text-based user interfaces. There's a browser-compatible fork called `blessed-contrib` that can be used for creating dashboards and other CLI-like interfaces in the browser.

   ```sh
   npm install blessed-contrib
   ```

3. **readline-browserify**: A version of Node's readline for the browser. It can be used to handle command-line input and history in a way that's similar to Node's readline module.

   ```sh
   npm install readline-browserify
   ```

4. **jquery.terminal**: A jQuery plugin for creating terminal-like interfaces in your web application. It supports command-line history, tab completion, and rich text output.

   ```sh
   npm install jquery.terminal
   ```

5. **hterm**: A JS library that provides a terminal emulator. It's used by the Chromium project and might be overkill for your needs, but it's a powerful option if you need something robust.

   ```sh
   npm install hterm
   ```

6. **ace**: Ace is a standalone code editor written in JavaScript. While it's not specifically a CLI interface, it can be used for creating sophisticated text input areas with syntax highlighting and other features you'd expect in a code editor.

   ```sh
   npm install ace-builds
   ```

Since you mentioned you have already implemented some interactions and the WPM calculator, you might find that a simpler package like `xterm.js` or `jquery.terminal` would suffice for your needs. These libraries provide you with the basic terminal functionality such as input/output handling, text display, and user input history.

Remember to check the documentation for each package to ensure compatibility with your current setup and to understand how to integrate them into your Hugo site. Each library comes with its own set of features and API, so you'll want to pick the one that fits your project's requirements and your comfort level with its API.
