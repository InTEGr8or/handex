TITLE: Langchain Script

I want to add a script to this repo that will loop through the files in the `docs\chats\`, parse them into smaller pieces if need be, and send them to my OpenAI Chat GPT API or any better tool to read the contents of the chat and rename the files with a better name that better reflects the contents of the file. I would also like it to put a summary at the top of the file.

I think the tool I should use might be Langchain to use commands that I can reuse against many GPTs, but I am not sure about that. It would be best to have a layer between my business logic and the specific API I will call, but I am not sure that Langchain is the best layer for that.

How should I start this task?

---

**Codeium** _at 8:07 am, May 2, 2024_

To start this task, you'll want to break it down into the following steps:

1. **Read the Chat Files**: Write a script to loop through the files in the `docs\chats\` directory. You'll need to use a programming language that can handle file I/O operations. Python is a good choice for such tasks.

2. **Parse the Chats**: Implement logic to parse the contents of each file. Depending on the structure of the chats, you may need to use regular expressions or string manipulation techniques to extract meaningful pieces.

3. **Summarize and Rename**: Use an NLP tool or API to generate summaries of the parsed content. OpenAI's GPT-3 or other similar services can be used to create summaries. Langchain is a good option if you want to maintain flexibility to switch between different LLMs (Large Language Models) easily in the future.

4. **Interact with the API**: Build the functionality to send requests to your chosen NLP API (such as OpenAI's GPT-3) to get the summaries.

5. **Write the Summaries and Rename Files**: Once you have the summaries, write them to the top of the files and rename the files based on the summary content.

Here's a high-level structure of how the code might look in Python:

```python
import os
import openai  # or another library if you're using a different API
import re

# Define the directory containing the chat files
directory = "docs/chats/"

# Loop through each file in the directory
for filename in os.listdir(directory):
    if filename.endswith(".md"):  # assuming the files are Markdown
        filepath = os.path.join(directory, filename)
        
        # Read the content of the file
        with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            content = file.read()
        
        # Parse the content into smaller pieces if needed
        # For example:
        # chat_contents = re.split(r'some_pattern', content)
        
        # Obtain a summary from the API
        # You will need to set up the API and provide the necessary keys and configuration
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="text-davinci-003",
            prompt="Summarize this chat: " + content,
            max_tokens=50  # Adjust as needed
        )
        summary = response.choices[0].text.strip()
        
        # Write the summary to the top of the file
        with open(filepath, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            file.write("Summary: " + summary + "\n\n" + content)
        
        # Rename the file based on the summary
        # You will need to create a valid filename from the summary
        new_filename = summary.replace(" ", "_") + ".md"
        new_filepath = os.path.join(directory, new_filename)
        os.rename(filepath, new_filepath)

# Replace 'openai.Completion.create' with the corresponding function call
# if you are using Langchain or a different API.
```

Please note that the above script is a simplified example. You'll need to handle edge cases, such as very long summaries, invalid filenames, rate limiting from the API, and potential errors in API responses.

If you choose to use Langchain, you'll need to replace the API interaction part with Langchain's API client calls.

Before running this script, you'll need to install the necessary libraries (like `openai` for OpenAI's API) and set your API key.

Lastly, always ensure that you comply with the terms of service of the NLP API you are using, and handle data with care, especially if it contains sensitive information.

I am getting `You tried to access openai.Completion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0` error

---

**Codeium** _at 8:21 am, May 2, 2024_

The error message indicates that the way you're trying to access the OpenAI API is not supported in the version of the `openai` library you have installed. In versions of the `openai` library from `1.0.0` and above, the interface to create completions has changed.

Here's how you can update your code to work with the newer version of the `openai` library:

```python
import openai

# Configure your API key (usually this is done through environment variables)
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

# Use the `ChatCompletion` or `Completion` class to create a completion
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize this chat:"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": content}  # Your chat content here
    ]
)

summary = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
```

Please note that in this updated code snippet, I've used the `ChatCompletion` class which is designed for chat-style interactions. Adjust the structure of the `messages` list according to your specific chat data and the responses you expect from the model.

Make sure to replace `'your-api-key'` with your actual OpenAI API key and install the appropriate `openai` library version if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install openai --upgrade
```

Remember to handle exceptions and error responses appropriately in your production code.

**User** _at 8:27 am, May 2, 2024_

I use OpenAI elsewhere on this machine and I've stored the key in the standard environment variable.

---

**Codeium** _at 8:27 am, May 2, 2024_

Great, since you have already stored your OpenAI API key in an environment variable, you don't need to set it explicitly in your script. Python can access environment variables using the `os` module.

You can modify the script like so:

```python
import os
import openai

# Access the API key from the environment variable
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Use the `ChatCompletion` or `Completion` class to create a completion
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize this chat:"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": content}  # Your chat content here
    ]
)

summary = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
```

Make sure the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to the correct value. In a Unix-like terminal, you can check this with:

```bash
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Or in Windows Command Prompt:

```cmd
echo %OPENAI_API_KEY%
```

Proceed with your script to read files, generate summaries, and rename them using this approach to access the OpenAI API. Remember to handle the response correctly and include error checking in your script.

**User** _at 9:04 am, May 2, 2024_

I'm doing this to find the date, but I only want the first occurance. Can I prevent Python from searching the whole file?

```py
    # Look for the first occurrence of the pattern matching `**User** _at 10:18 am, Apr 24, 2024_` and convert it to a datetime object
    datetime_pattern = r'\d{1,2}:\d{2} [ap]m, [A-Z][a-z]{2} \d{1,2}, \d{4}'
    datetime = re.search(datetime_pattern, content)
    if datetime:
      datetime = datetime.group(0)
```

---

**Codeium** _at 9:04 am, May 2, 2024_

In Python's `re.search()` function, it will stop searching as soon as it finds the first occurrence of the pattern, so you are already only getting the first match. If you want to ensure that you're not processing the rest of the file unnecessarily, you could read the file line by line until you find the first occurrence. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import re

datetime_pattern = r'\d{1,2}:\d{2} [ap]m, [A-Z][a-z]{2} \d{1,2}, \d{4}'
datetime_str = None

with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    for line in file:
        datetime_match = re.search(datetime_pattern, line)
        if datetime_match:
            datetime_str = datetime_match.group(0)
            break  # Exit the loop after the first occurrence

if datetime_str:
    # Convert the datetime_str to a datetime object using strptime, if necessary
    pass
```

This will ensure that as soon as a date in the correct format is found, it stops reading the file, which could potentially save time if the file is large and the date is near the beginning.

**User** _at 9:43 am, May 2, 2024_

I need to convert this string into a `date` object in Python: `10:18 am, Apr 24, 2024`

---

**Codeium** _at 9:43 am, May 2, 2024_

To convert the string `10:18 am, Apr 24, 2024` into a `datetime` object in Python, you can use `datetime.strptime` method from the `datetime` module, which allows you to specify the exact format of your date string. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from datetime import datetime

date_str = "10:18 am, Apr 24, 2024"
date_format = "%I:%M %p, %b %d, %Y"

date_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, date_format)
```

In the format string `%I:%M %p, %b %d, %Y`:

- `%I` is the hour (01 to 12)
- `%M` is the minute (00 to 59)
- `%p` is the locale’s equivalent of either AM or PM
- `%b` is the abbreviated month name
- `%d` is the day of the month (01 to 31)
- `%Y` is the year with century as a decimal number

This will give you a `datetime` object representing the date and time specified in `date_str`.

**User** _at 10:15 am, May 2, 2024_

how do I get the file datetime and load it into a similar `date_obj`?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:15 am, May 2, 2024_

To extract the date and time from the content of a file and convert it into a `datetime` object, first you will need to match the date string using a regular expression, as you have already done. Then, you will use `datetime.strptime()` to convert the matched string into a `datetime` object.

Here's how you can do it step by step:

1. Open the file and read its contents.
2. Use a regular expression to find the date and time string.
3. Parse the string into a `datetime` object.

Here is the code that does this:

```python
import re
from datetime import datetime

# Define the pattern to match the datetime string in the file
datetime_pattern = r'\d{1,2}:\d{2} [ap]m, [A-Z][a-z]{2} \d{1,2}, \d{4}'

# Open the file and read its contents
with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    content = file.read()

# Search for the first occurrence of the datetime pattern
datetime_match = re.search(datetime_pattern, content)
if datetime_match:
    datetime_str = datetime_match.group(0)
    # Define the format of the datetime string
    date_format = "%I:%M %p, %b %d, %Y"
    # Parse the datetime string into a datetime object
    date_obj = datetime.strptime(datetime_str, date_format)
    print(date_obj)  # This will print the datetime object
else:
    print("No datetime pattern found in the file.")
```

Replace `filepath` with the actual path to the file you want to process. The `date_obj` is a `datetime` object representing the date and time extracted from the file. If the pattern is not found in the content, it will print a message indicating that.

How can I get a date object from this `os.path.getmtime(filepath)`?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:16 am, May 2, 2024_

The `os.path.getmtime(filepath)` function returns the last modification time of a file as a timestamp, which is the number of seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). To convert this timestamp into a `datetime` object, you can use the `datetime.fromtimestamp()` method from the `datetime` module. Here is how you can do it:

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Get the last modified time as a timestamp
timestamp = os.path.getmtime(filepath)

# Convert the timestamp to a datetime object
date_obj = datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp)

print(date_obj)  # This will print the datetime object
```

The `date_obj` will be a `datetime` object representing the last modification time of the file specified by `filepath`.

---

**User** _at 10:16 am, May 2, 2024_

What if I want the file creation time instead of the last modified time?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:16 am, May 2, 2024_

To get the creation time of a file, you can use `os.path.getctime(filepath)` on most platforms. This function returns the system's ctime which, on some systems (like Unix), is the time of the last metadata change, and on Windows, it's the creation time of the file.

Here's how you can get the creation time and convert it to a `datetime` object:

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Get the creation time as a timestamp
timestamp = os.path.getctime(filepath)

# Convert the timestamp to a datetime object
creation_date_obj = datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp)

print(creation_date_obj)  # This will print the datetime object representing the file's creation time
```

Keep in mind that the exact meaning of ctime might vary across operating systems. If you are on Windows, `getctime` should work fine for getting the creation time. However, on Unix systems, you might not get the creation time as this information is not stored by all file systems. If you need reliable creation times across all platforms and file systems, you might need to look into other methods of storing and retrieving this information, such as metadata within the file or a database entry.

**User** _at 10:21 am, May 2, 2024_

I am trying to skip files that were modified today, but I get an error that `timedelta` is not recognized:

```py
    if datetime.now() - datetime.fromtimestamp(file_modification_datetime) < timedelta(days=1):
      continue
```

---

**Codeium** _at 10:21 am, May 2, 2024_

The error you're experiencing suggests that the `timedelta` class has not been imported from the `datetime` module. To fix this issue, you need to make sure you have the following import statement at the beginning of your script:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

Here is the corrected version of your code with the proper imports:

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# ... your existing code ...

file_modification_datetime = os.path.getmtime(filepath)
# If the file was modified within the last 24 hours, skip it
if datetime.now() - datetime.fromtimestamp(file_modification_datetime) < timedelta(days=1):
    continue

# ... the rest of your code ...
```

With this import statement, `timedelta` will be recognized, and you'll be able to create `timedelta` objects to perform operations with `datetime` objects.

How do I do a ternary operator in Python if the `date_obj == None`?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:27 am, May 2, 2024_

In Python, the ternary operator is often expressed as a one-liner if-else statement. If you want to assign a value based on whether `date_obj` is `None` or not, you can use the following syntax:

```python
value = some_value if date_obj is not None else another_value
```

Here's a specific example where you might want to assign a default date if `date_obj` is `None`:

```python
default_date = datetime(1970, 1, 1)  # This is an arbitrary default date
date_obj = default_date if date_obj is None else date_obj
```

This means "use `default_date` if `date_obj` is `None`, otherwise use `date_obj` itself".

        + content
```

---

**Codeium** _at 10:33 am, May 2, 2024_

The issue with your code seems to be due to the way you are concatenating strings across multiple lines. In Python, when you break a string across multiple lines, you need to enclose the entire expression in parentheses, or use a backslash `\` at the end of each line to indicate that the statement continues on the next line.

Additionally, if `datetime` is a `datetime` object, you'll need to convert it to a string. Assuming `datetime` is already a string representing the date, here's how you can fix the string concatenation:

```python
new_content = (
    "---\n" 
    "original file name: " + filename + "\n" 
    "summary: " + summary + "\n" 
    "date: " + str(datetime) + "\n"  # If datetime is a datetime object, you need to format it to a string
    "---\n\n" +
    content
)
```

If `datetime` is actually a `datetime` object, you need to format it to a string properly. For example:

```python
date_str = datetime.strftime(date_obj, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")  # Format the datetime object to a string
new_content = (
    "---\n" 
    "original file name: " + filename + "\n" 
    "summary: " + summary + "\n" 
    "date: " + date_str + "\n"  # Use the formatted date string
    "---\n\n" +
    content
)
```

Make sure you have a valid string for `summary` and `filename` as well.

```

I had tested it a few times while testing the first run and it worked, maybe because it selects the files in different orders?

How can I fix this problem?

---

**Codeium** _at 10:48 am, May 2, 2024_

The error message you're receiving from the OpenAI API indicates that the combined length of your messages exceeds the maximum context length allowed by the model, which is 16385 tokens.

To address this issue, you need to ensure that the content you're sending to the API does not exceed this token limit. Here are a couple of approaches you could take:

1. **Truncate the Content**: Before sending the content to the API, truncate it to a certain length that you know will be within the token limit.

```python
# Define a safe character limit, for example:
safe_char_limit = 15000  # Adjust this limit based on your observations

# Truncate the content if it's too long
truncated_content = content if len(content) <= safe_char_limit else content[:safe_char_limit]

# Now use `truncated_content` instead of `content` when sending to the API
```

2. **Split the Content**: If truncating is not desirable because you might lose important information, you could split the content into smaller chunks and summarize them individually. You would then need to concatenate these summaries or choose the most relevant one.

```python
# Define a safe character limit that you know will be within the token limit
safe_char_limit = 15000  # Adjust this limit based on your observations

# Split the content into smaller chunks
chunks = [content[i:i + safe_char_limit] for i in range(0, len(content), safe_char_limit)]

# Summarize each chunk and then combine or choose the most relevant summary
summaries = []
for chunk in chunks:
    # Call the API to summarize the chunk
    # ... API call logic ...
    
    # Append the summary to the summaries list
    summaries.append(summary_from_api)

# Now you can concatenate the summaries or choose the most relevant one
combined_summary = ' '.join(summaries)
```

3. **Refine Your Search**: If the length of the messages is due to verbose chat history, consider refining your search to extract only the most pertinent parts of the conversation before sending them to the API for summarization.

Remember to handle the summaries appropriately in your script, especially if you split the content into chunks, as you'll need to decide how to merge these summaries into a cohesive whole.

Lastly, ensure that your usage of the OpenAI API aligns with the OpenAI usage policies, including respecting rate limits and proper handling of data.

how do i use `replace()` in Python to replace all instances of?

---

**Codeium** _at 11:25 am, May 2, 2024_

In Python, you can use the `replace()` method of a string to replace all instances of a specified substring with another substring. The `replace()` method is called on the string object and takes two arguments: the substring to be replaced and the substring to replace it with.

Here's the syntax:

```python
new_string = original_string.replace(old_substring, new_substring)
```

For example, if you want to replace all instances of `'cat'` with `'dog'` in a string, you would do the following:

```python
original_string = "The cat sat on the mat with another cat."
new_string = original_string.replace('cat', 'dog')

print(new_string)  # Output: The dog sat on the mat with another dog.
```

The `replace()` method will replace all occurrences of `'cat'` with `'dog'` in `original_string`, and the result will be stored in `new_string`. If no instances of the old substring are found, the original string is returned unchanged.

How would I replace all backticks in a string?

---

**Codeium** _at 11:26 am, May 2, 2024_

To replace all backticks (`` ` ``) in a string with another character or string, you can use the `replace()` method as well. If you wanted to replace all backticks with, for example, single quotes (`'`), you would do the following:

```python
original_string = "This is a `code` example with `backticks`."
new_string = original_string.replace('`', "'")

print(new_string)  # Output: This is a 'code' example with 'backticks'.
```

Here, every backtick in `original_string` is replaced with a single quote, and the result is stored in `new_string`. If you want to remove the backticks instead of replacing them with another character, you would use an empty string (`''`) as the replacement:

```python
new_string = original_string.replace('`', '')
```

---

**User** _at 11:26 am, May 2, 2024_

what would happen if I used `.replace("`")`?

---

**Codeium** _at 11:27 am, May 2, 2024_

If you try to use `.replace("`")` in Python, you'll encounter a syntax error because the quotation marks are not correctly paired. The backtick (` ` `) is not a valid string delimiter in Python, so you can't use it to define a string. In Python, strings must be enclosed in matching single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`).

Here's how you would use `.replace()` to replace backticks with an empty string (effectively removing them):

```python
original_string = "This is a `code` example with `backticks`."
new_string = original_string.replace('`', '')

print(new_string)  # Output: This is a code example with backticks.
```

In this corrected example, the backticks are replaced with an empty string (`''`), which removes them from the `original_string`. The `replace()` method takes the old substring to replace as the first argument (in this case, the backtick '`') and the new substring to replace it with as the second argument (in this case, an empty string to remove the backticks).

I meant to write `.replace("``")`

Using `.replace("``")` in Python would still result in a syntax error because the string is not closed properly. The correct way to use `.replace()` to remove backticks would be to enclose the backtick in either single or double quotes and then specify the replacement string. Here's the correct usage:

```python
original_string = "This is a `code` example with `backticks`."
new_string = original_string.replace('`', '')

print(new_string)  # Output: This is a code example with backticks.
```

If you want to specify the backtick using double quotes, you need to escape the backtick with a backslash (`\`) inside the string:

```python
new_string = original_string.replace("\`", '')
```

However, note that in Python, it's not necessary to escape backticks inside double-quoted strings, so the first example without the backslash is sufficient and more readable.

I didn't strip enough from the file names and now some of them have bad characters.

How can I write a PowerShell script that will loop through the directory and remove all sequences like `-_`, the backtick character, `'`, `_-` from all filenames in the directory?

In PowerShell, you can use the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet to retrieve the files in the directory, and then use `Rename-Item` to rename them by removing the specified sequences of characters. Here's a PowerShell script that will loop through all files in the specified directory and remove the sequences `-_`, backtick, `'`, and `_-` from their filenames:

```powershell
# Define the path to the directory containing the files
$directoryPath = "C:\Path\To\Your\Directory"

# Get all files in the directory
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $directoryPath

foreach ($file in $files) {
    # Store the original file name
    $originalName = $file.Name

    # Remove the sequences by replacing them with an empty string
    $newName = $originalName -replace "-_",''
    $newName = $newName -replace "`",''
    $newName = $newName -replace "'",''
    $newName = $newName -replace "_-",''

    # Rename the file if the new name is different from the original name
    if ($newName -ne $originalName) {
        Rename-Item -Path $file.FullName -NewName $newName
    }
}
```

Make sure to replace `C:\Path\To\Your\Directory` with the actual path to your directory. The script will iterate over each file and create a new name by replacing the specified sequences with an empty string. If the new name is different from the original name, it will use `Rename-Item` to rename the file.

Please be careful when running scripts that rename files, as it can be difficult to undo the changes. It's a good idea to test the script on a small set of files or a copy of your data to ensure it works as expected before running it on all files in a directory.

Can you use the pipe character to compress that to a single line?

---

**Codeium** _at 11:35 am, May 2, 2024_

Certainly! You can chain the `-replace` operations using the pipe character `|` in PowerShell, which passes the output of one operation as the input to the next. Here's how you can compress the replacement logic into a single line within the loop:

```powershell
# Define the path to the directory containing the files
$directoryPath = "C:\Path\To\Your\Directory"

# Get all files in the directory
Get-ChildItem -Path $directoryPath | ForEach-Object {
    # Create the new name by removing the specified sequences
    $newName = $_.Name -replace "-_",'' -replace "`",'' -replace "'",'' -replace "_-",''

    # Rename the file if the new name is different from the original name
    if ($newName -ne $_.Name) {
        Rename-Item -Path $_.FullName -NewName $newName
    }
}
```

In this script, `Get-ChildItem` retrieves all files from the specified directory and passes them to `ForEach-Object`. Inside the loop, the `-replace` operations are chained together to create `$newName`. If `$newName` differs from the original name, `Rename-Item` renames the file.

As always, be cautious when running scripts that perform bulk operations on files, and consider backing up your files first.

Back to Python, how can I regex replace a bunch of characters in a string?

---

**Codeium** _at 11:45 am, May 2, 2024_

In Python, you can use the `re.sub()` function from the `re` (regular expressions) module to replace a bunch of characters in a string. This function allows you to specify a pattern to match and a replacement string. Here is a general syntax:

```python
import re

# The original string
original_string = "Some string with -_special`characters'_- to replace."

# The pattern to match all characters you want to replace (for example, -`,')
pattern = r"[-_`']"

# The replacement string (an empty string to remove the characters)
replacement = ""

# Perform the replacement
new_string = re.sub(pattern, replacement, original_string)

print(new_string)
```

In the `pattern` variable, you define a regular expression that matches any of the characters you want to replace. In the example above, the pattern `r"[-_`']"` will match any hyphen `-`, underscore `_`, backtick `` ` ``, or single quote `'`.

The `re.sub()` function then replaces all occurrences of this pattern in `original_string` with `replacement`, which in this case is an empty string, effectively removing the specified characters.

Remember that some characters have special meanings in regular expressions (such as the hyphen `-` and backtick `` ` ``), so they may need to be escaped or placed in a specific order within the character class. In the pattern above, the hyphen is placed at the beginning to avoid escaping, as it would denote a range between characters if placed between other characters.

Ok, I have the working `summarize-chats.py` and I've renamed all the files and they have AI generated summaries at the top. 

What would it look like if I had implemented this in Langchain?

Would I be able to run it against other GPT models and services?

How different would the code be?

---

**Codeium** _at 11:54 am, May 2, 2024_

Implementing your `summarize-chats.py` script using Langchain would allow you to abstract away the direct dependency on a specific GPT model or service. Langchain provides a unified interface to interact with different LLMs (Large Language Models), making it easier to switch between models or services without significantly altering your business logic.

Here's a rough outline of what the code might look like if you were using Langchain:

1. **Set up Langchain**: You need to install Langchain and configure it with your API keys for the services you want to use (e.g., OpenAI, AI21, etc.).

2. **Create a Langchain Client**: You would create a client that is configured for the specific LLM you wish to use.

3. **Use the Client to Summarize**: Instead of calling the OpenAI API directly, you would use Langchain's methods to send the content to the LLM and receive a summary.

4. **Process Files**: The rest of your file processing (renaming, adding summaries, etc.) would remain largely the same.

The code difference primarily comes in how you interact with the LLM. Here's a hypothetical example of how part of the script might change:

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Initialize the Langchain client with OpenAI
llm = OpenAI(api_key='your_openai_api_key')

# Example function to get a summary using Langchain
def get_summary(content):
    response = llm.generate(
        prompt="Summarize this chat: " + content,
        max_tokens=50,  # Adjust as needed
        stop=None,      # Define any stopping behavior if needed
        temperature=0   # This can be adjusted based on the desired creativity
    )
    summary = response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()
    return summary

# ... rest of your script where you read files and call get_summary() ...
```

If you wanted to switch to a different LLM, you could replace the `OpenAI` class with another class provided by Langchain for the service you're interested in (e.g., `AI21Studio` for AI21 Labs' Jurassic models).

Langchain aims to make it easier to switch between these services with minimal changes to your code. You might only need to change the class used to initialize the client and ensure you have the appropriate API keys configured.

Please note that the specific methods and class names used in Langchain could be different, so you should refer to the Langchain documentation for the exact details on how to implement it.
