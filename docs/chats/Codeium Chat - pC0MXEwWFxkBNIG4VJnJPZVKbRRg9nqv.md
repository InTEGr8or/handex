Explain problem: `Object is possibly 'null'.`

The issue "Object is possibly 'null'." arises in TypeScript because `document.querySelector<HTMLDivElement>("div.content")` can potentially return `null`, and accessing properties or methods on a potentially null value can lead to runtime errors.

To address this, you can perform a null check before accessing properties or methods on the result of `document.querySelector<HTMLDivElement>("div.content")` to ensure it's not null. This can be done like so:

```typescript
const divContent = document.querySelector<HTMLDivElement>("div.content");
if (divContent) {
    // Safely use divContent here
    divContent.appendChild(this.chordSection);
}
``` 

By performing this null check, you avoid the "Object is possibly 'null'." issue and ensure safe access to the `div.content` element.
