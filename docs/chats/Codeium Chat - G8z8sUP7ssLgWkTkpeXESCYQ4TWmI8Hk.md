Explain problem: `Object is possibly 'null'.`

The issue "Object is possibly 'null'" in TypeScript indicates that there is a possibility of `this.preview` being `null` at the point where it is accessed. TypeScript is warning you that it cannot guarantee `this.preview` will have a value when you try to access it.

To address this issue, you can add a null check before accessing `this.preview` to ensure it is not null. Here's how you can modify the code to handle this:

```typescript
if (this.preview) {
    if (this.preview.srcObject) {
        (this.preview.srcObject as MediaStream).getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
    }
    this.preview.srcObject = null;
}
```

By adding the null check `if (this.preview)`, you are ensuring that you only access `this.preview` if it is not null, thereby resolving the "Object is possibly 'null'" issue.

I am not sure how to replace this line with that:

```ts
        .then(
          (stream: MediaStream) => (this.preview.srcObject = stream)
        );
```

To handle potential null values for `this.preview` when setting `srcObject` with the stream, you can use an if-check within the `.then` callback to ensure that `this.preview` is not null before assigning the `srcObject`. Here's the updated line with a null check:

```typescript
.then((stream: MediaStream) => {
    if (this.preview) {
        this.preview.srcObject = stream;
    }
});
```

This ensures that you are only trying to set `srcObject` on `this.preview` if `this.preview` is indeed not null, avoiding any potential runtime errors that would occur if `this.preview` were null at that point in the code.
